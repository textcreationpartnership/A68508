         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Thus (dearely beloued in the Lord) haue I briefly run ouer the expoſition of this firſt verſe: let mee now vpon it build ſome doctrine, for the building vp of our ſelues in our holy faith. You will be pleaſed to remember with me, that <hi>Amos</hi> of a <hi>heardman</hi> or a <hi>ſhepherd</hi> became a bleſſed <hi>Prophet</hi> to carrie a terrible <hi>word,</hi> and fearfull meſſage from the liuing God, to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1736:9"/> King, Nobles, Prieſts, and people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The doctrine to be grounded hereupon, I deliuer in this propoſition;
<q>God chuſeth vile and deſpiſed perſons, to confound the great and mighty.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vile and deſpiſed perſons, I call ſuch, as to the world, to humane wiſdome, and to the eye of reaſon are of no price, eſteeme, or worth. Such as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was, when he kept ſheepe in <hi>Canaan</hi> with his brethren, and was by them ſold to the <hi>Iſmae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, Gen.</hi> 37.2, 27. Such as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, when firſt he was caſt into the flags, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.1. Such as <hi>Dauid</hi> was while he medled with ſheepfolds, and followed the ewes great with young, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.70. Such as were <hi>Peter, Andrew, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> while they buſied themſelues about mending of nets, and catching of fiſh, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.18.21. Theſe, <hi>Joſeph, Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds; <hi>Peter, Andrew, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> fiſhermen, vile and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed in the account of the world, were choſen by the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the great God of heauen, one to be a ruler in <hi>Egypt;</hi> another to be a leader of Gods people; the third to be a King; the reſt to be Chriſts Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>Heare now a word of eternall verity, and full of comfort. You ſhall finde it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.7, 8. The Lord who is high aboue all nations, and glorious aboue the heauens, <hi>he raiſeth the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy out of the duſt, and lifteth vp the poore out of the dung, to ſet him with Princes. S. Pauls</hi> diſcourſe touching this point is more large and ſpatious. You ſhall find it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27, 28. <hi>God hath choſen the fooliſh things of this world to confound the wiſe, and the weake things to confound the ſtrong, and vile things, and things deſpiſed, and things which are not, to bring to nought the things that are.</hi> The reaſon of Gods dealing thus in the aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the fooliſh, weak, vile, deſpiſed, needy &amp; poor, to places of dignity, is expreſſed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.29. It is, <hi>that no fleſh ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in his preſence,</hi> that is, that no man ſhould glory before the Lord. In this reaſon are two things worthy our religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, as <hi>Muſculus</hi> well obſerueth. For hereby our God firſt ſuppreſſeth and beateth downe the pride of fleſh, and takes from it all glory of wiſdome, power and nobility; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, whatſoeuer glory there is of wiſdome, power and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1736:10"/> he doth claime and challenge it for his owne peculiar. Thus haue you (dearely beloued) the confirmation of my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. The doctrine was:
<q>God chooſeth vile and deſpiſed perſons, to confound the great and mighty.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Be patient, I beſeech you, while I point at ſome vſes of it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt vſe is to lift vp our minds to the contemplation of Gods good <hi>prouidence.</hi> Poore ſhepherds and fiſhermen God exalteth and aduanceth into the higheſt places of dignitie in Church and common-wealth. Hereby wee know that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Empire</hi> nor <hi>Kingdome,</hi> nor <hi>place</hi> in them of dignitie, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oritie, or preeminence, Eccleſiaſticall or politique, is gotten by the induſtrie, wiſdome, wit, or ſtrength of man: but that all are adminiſtred, ruled, and gouerned by the deputation and ordination of the higheſt power, God almightie.</p>

                  <p>After my expoſition giuen vpon thoſe fiue parts of that text, I recald to your remembrances, that <hi>Amos</hi> of a heardman, or ſhepherd, became a bleſſed Prophet to carry a terrible word and fearfull meſſage from the liuing God to the king, nobles, prieſts, and people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Thereupon I commended to you this doctrine:
<q>God chooſeth vile and deſpiſed perſons to condemne the great and mighty.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That doctrine proued, I recommended to you the vſes of it. The firſt was to lift vp your mindes to the contemplation of Gods good prouidence. Poore ſhepherds and fiſhermen God exalteth and aduanceth into the higheſt places of dignity in church and common wealth. This might perſwade you that neither Empire, nor kingdome, nor place in them of dignitie, priority or preeminence, eccleſiaſticall or politique, is gotten by the induſtry, wiſdome, wit, or ſtrength of man, but that all are adminiſtred, ruled, and gouerned by the deputation and ordinance of the higheſt power, <hi>God almighty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond was to ſtop blaſphemous mouths, ſuch as are euermore open againſt the God of Heauen, to affirme, that all things below the moone, are ruled by their blind goddeſſe <hi>fortune</hi> and by <hi>chance.</hi> Here my deſire was, that your hearts might be ioined with mine in the conſideration of Gods moſt ſweet and neuer ſleeping care ouer vs in this lower world: that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1736:13"/> we would not ſuppoſe our God, to be a God to halfes and in part only, a God aboue and not beneath the Moone, a God in the greater and not in the leſſer employments.</p>
                  <p>To this holy meditation I exhorted you, taught by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcriptures, that our God examineth the leaſt moments &amp; tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles in the world, that you can imagine, to a handfull of meale, to a cruſe of oile in a poore widowes houſe; to the falling of the Sparrowes to the ground; to the feeding of the birds of the aire; to the caluing of Hindes; to the clothing of the graſſe of the field; to the numbring of the haires of our heads; to the trickling of teares downe our cheekes. Thus farre as Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſpirit aſſiſted me, I led you the laſt time. Now let it pleaſe you with patience and reuerence to giue eare to the word of God, as it followeth, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2.</p>

                  <p>This powerfull and great <hi>Iehouah,</hi> God almighty, ſpake in <hi>old</hi> time to our <hi>fathers</hi> by the mouth of <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 4.12. and in the <hi>mouthes</hi> of all his <hi>Prophets, Heb.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Know this,</hi> ſaith <hi>S.

                  <p>This <hi>Lord,</hi> who thus ſpake in <hi>old</hi> time by his <hi>Prophets,</hi> did in fulneſſe of time, when he ſent his Son to conſummate, and perfect the worke of mans redemption, ſpeake by his bleſſed Euangeliſts, and Apoſtles.

The duties wee ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> him in this reſpect are three: to <hi>obey</hi> him, to <hi>ſerue</hi> him, <hi>to profit</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>The firſt duty required of vs, is <hi>obedience</hi> vnto God his word, laws and commandements. This duty whoſoeuer performeth, ſhall eaſily performe the ſecond duty, to wit, faithfull <hi>ſeruice,</hi> with all care and diligence to doe whatſoeuer worke it pleaſeth God to employ him in: and ſhall not leaue vndone the third duty, but ſhall doe <hi>good,</hi> and be <hi>profitable</hi> vnto the <hi>Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe duties were well diſcharged by our firſt parent <hi>Adam.</hi> As long as he was inueſted with his robe of innocency, he was perfectly <hi>obedient,</hi> a faithfull <hi>ſeruant,</hi> and <hi>profitable</hi> to his <hi>Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if it will be doubted here how a man ſhould be <hi>profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to God, thus I anſwer: That Gods <hi>riches</hi> doe conſiſt in his <hi>glory,</hi> and therefore if his <hi>glory</hi> be increaſed and enlarged, his <hi>aduantage</hi> is procured. The parable of the talents, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.14. confirmeth this point. The parable is there plainly deliuered vnto you. The meaning of it is; that God giueth vs his graces to this end, that wee ſhould <hi>vſe</hi> and increaſe them for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage. Yea God there compareth himſelfe to a couetous <hi>vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in the 22. chapt. of <hi>Iob verſ.</hi> 2, 3. ſeemeth in word to thwart, and croſſe this doctrine. For ſaith he, may a man be <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable</hi> vnto <hi>God? Is it any thing to the Almighty, that thou are righteous? Or is it profitable to him, that thou makeſt thy waies vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right?</hi> I anſwer, that <hi>God</hi> indeed is not ſo tied to <hi>man,</hi> but that he can ſet forth his <hi>glory,</hi> without him, or his righteouſneſſe; yea hee can glorifie himſelfe in the vnrighteouſneſſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of man: yet I ſay, that to ſtirre vp man to holineſſe, it
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1736:20"/> pleaſeth God in mercy to count only that glory gained, which is gained by the obedience of his ſeruants. And therefore I ſay againe, that <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of his innocency was perfectly <hi>obedient,</hi> a faithfull <hi>ſeruant,</hi> and <hi>profitable</hi> to his <hi>Lord.</hi>
                  </p>

Behold,</hi> (ſaith he) God <hi>hath found no ſtedfaſtneſſe in his Saints, yea the heauens are not cleane in his ſight; how much more</hi> is man vnſtedfaſt, how much more <hi>abominable, and filthy, drinking iniquity like water?</hi> When the <hi>Lord looked downe from heauen,</hi> to ſee whether there were any childe of man, that would vnderſtand, and ſeeke God, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 14.2. could he finde any one framed according to the rule of that perfection, which he requireth?

                     <hi>Gregory</hi> moſt accurately handleth this queſtion to this ſenſe: <hi>God</hi> ſpeaketh two manner of wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By himſelfe, as when he ſpeaketh to the heart by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inſpiration of the <hi>holy Spirit.</hi> After which ſenſe we muſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1736:23"/> vnderſtand that which we read, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.29. <hi>The ſpirit ſaid vnto</hi> Philip; <hi>go neere and ioyne thy ſelfe to yonder chariot:</hi> that is, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> was inwardly moued, to draw neare and ioyne himſelfe to the chariot wherein the <hi>Aethiopian Eunuch</hi> ſate, and read the Prophecie of <hi>Eſay.</hi> The like words we finde, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.19. <hi>The ſpirit ſaid vnto Peter, Behold three men ſeeke thee:</hi> the meaning is the ſame: <hi>Peter</hi> was inwardly moued by the holy Spirit to depart from <hi>Ioppa,</hi> and to goe to <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> to preach vnto the Gentiles to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company. Where we may note thus much for our comforts, that whenſoeuer we are <hi>inwardly moued,</hi> and doe feele our <hi>hearts touched</hi> with an earneſt deſire, either to make our priuate requeſts vnto <hi>God,</hi> or to come to the place of <hi>publike prayer,</hi> or to heare a <hi>ſermon,</hi> we may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the <hi>Holy Spirit, God</hi> by himſelfe ſpeakes vnto vs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 God ſpeaketh to vs by his creatures <hi>Angelicall,</hi> and other, and that in diuers manners.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>In word only,</hi> as when no forme is ſeene, but a voice on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is heard: as <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.28. when <hi>Chriſt</hi> prayed, <hi>Father, glorifie thy name;</hi> immediately there came a <hi>voice</hi> from heauen; I <hi>both haue glorified it, and will glorifie it againe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>In deed only:</hi> as when no <hi>voice</hi> is heard, but ſome ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance only is obiected to the ſenſes. <hi>S. Gregory</hi> for illuſtration of this ſecond way of Gods ſpeaking by his creatures, bringeth for example the viſion of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 1.4. He ſaw <hi>a whirlewind come out of the North, with a great cloud, and fire wrapped about it, and in the middeſt of the fire the likeneſſe of Amber.</hi> All this hee ſaw; but you heare no mention of any <hi>voice.</hi> Here was <hi>res ſine verbo;</hi> a deed, but no <hi>voice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 Both <hi>in word</hi> and <hi>deed;</hi> as when there is both a <hi>voice</hi> heard, and alſo ſome ſemblance obiected to the ſenſes: as happened vnto <hi>Adam</hi> preſently after his fall: Hee heard <hi>the voice of the Lord walking in the Garden, Gen.</hi> 3.8.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 By <hi>ſhapes</hi> preſented to the inward eyes of our hearts. So <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> in his dreame <hi>ſaw</hi> a ladder reach from earth to heauen, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.12. So <hi>Peter</hi> in a trance <hi>ſaw</hi> a veſſell deſcend from heauen, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.11. So <hi>Paul</hi> in a viſion <hi>ſaw</hi> a man of <hi>Macedonia</hi> ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by him, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.9.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. By <hi>Terreſtriall ſubſtances.</hi> So God to reproue the dulneſſe of <hi>Balaam,</hi> enabled <hi>Balaams</hi> owne <hi>Aſſe</hi> to ſpeak, <hi>Num.</hi> 22.28.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 Both by <hi>Celeſtiall</hi> and <hi>Terreſtriall ſubſtances,</hi> as when <hi>God</hi> appeared vnto <hi>Moſes</hi> in a flame of fire, out of the middeſt of a buſh, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.2.</p>
                  <p>You ſee now how God of old at ſundry times, and in diuers manners did <hi>ſpeake</hi> to man: either by <hi>himſelfe,</hi> or by <hi>his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi> and by <hi>his creatures</hi> many wayes: ſometimes in <hi>word,</hi> ſometimes in <hi>deed,</hi> ſometimes in both <hi>word and deed;</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in <hi>ſleepings,</hi> ſometimes in <hi>watchings;</hi> ſometimes by <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall ſubſtances,</hi> ſometime by <hi>Terreſtriall,</hi> ſometimes by <hi>both, Celeſtiall and Terreſtriall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To make ſome vſe of this doctrine; let vs conſider, whether <hi>God</hi> doth not now <hi>ſpeke</hi> vnto vs, as of old he did to our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers. We ſhal finde that now alſo he <hi>ſpeaketh</hi> vnto vs by <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,</hi> whenſoeuer by the inſpiration of his holy Spirit he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth our hearts to religious and pure thoughts; and alſo <hi>by his creatures:</hi> ſometime by <hi>fire,</hi> when he conſumeth our dwelling houſes: ſometime by <hi>thunder,</hi> when he throweth downe our ſtrong holds: ſometime <hi>by heat,</hi> ſometime <hi>by drouth,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time <hi>by noyſome worms, Locuſts,</hi> and <hi>Caterpillers,</hi> when he takes from vs the ſtaffe of bread; ſometime <hi>by plagues,</hi> when in a few months he taketh from vs many thouſands of our brethren; and ſometime <hi>by enemies,</hi> when he impoueriſheth vs by warre.</p>
                  <p>All theſe, and whatſoeuer other like theſe, are Gods <hi>voices,</hi> and doe call vs to tepentance. But as when there came a <hi>voice</hi> from heauen to <hi>Chriſt, Ioh.</hi> 12.28. the people that ſtood by
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1736:24"/> and heard, would not be perſwaded that it was Gods <hi>voice;</hi> ſome of them ſaying that <hi>it thundred,</hi> others that <hi>an Angell ſpake:</hi> ſo we, howſoeuer God layes his hand vpon vs, by <hi>fire,</hi> by <hi>thunder,</hi> by <hi>famine,</hi> by <hi>peſtilence,</hi> by <hi>war,</hi> or otherwiſe, we will not be perſwaded that God <hi>ſpeakes</hi> vnto vs; we will rather at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute theſe things to <hi>nature,</hi> to the <hi>heauens,</hi> to <hi>ſtarres</hi> and <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,</hi> to the <hi>malice of enemies,</hi> to <hi>chance,</hi> and the like.</p>
                  <p>As peruerſe as we are, there is a <hi>voice</hi> of God, which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but acknowledge to be his, and at this time to be directed vnto vs. Mention of it is made, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. <hi>In theſe laſt dayes God hath ſpoken to vs by his ſonne.</hi> The Goſpell of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>voice</hi> of God. It is the <hi>voice</hi> of God, the rule of all inſtruction, the firſt ſtone to be laid in the whole building: that cloud by day, that pillar by night, whereby all our actions are to be guided. This <hi>Goſpell</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>voice</hi> of God, cals vs now to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                  <p>O the crookedneſſe of our vile natures! Our <hi>ſtiffe</hi> necks will not bend. God <hi>ſpeaketh</hi> vnto vs by his Miniſters, to walke in the <hi>old way,</hi> the good way; but we anſwer like them, <hi>Ier.</hi> 6.16. <hi>We will not walke therein.</hi> He ſpeaketh to vs by his watchmen, to take heed to the ſound of the trumpet; but we anſwer like them, <hi>Ier.</hi> 6.17. <hi>We will not take heed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Turne vs good <hi>Lord</hi> vnto thee, and wee ſhall bee turned. Good <hi>Lord</hi> open thou our eares, that if it be thy holy will, either to <hi>Roare</hi> vnto vs, or to <hi>ſpeake</hi> with a milder <hi>voice:</hi> either to come againſt in <hi>iudgement,</hi> or to viſit vs in <hi>mercy;</hi> wee may readily heare thee, and yeeld obedience: and as obedient chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren receiue the promiſe of eternall inheritance. So when the time of our ſeparation ſhall be, that we muſt leaue this world, a place of <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> of <hi>trouble,</hi> of <hi>vexation,</hi> of <hi>anguiſh,</hi> thou, <hi>Lord</hi> wilt tranſlate vs to a better place, a place of <hi>light</hi> where <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> ſhall be no more; a place of <hi>reſt,</hi> where <hi>trouble</hi> ſhall be no more; a place of <hi>delight,</hi> where <hi>vexation</hi> ſhall be no more; a place of endleſſe and vnſpeakable <hi>ioyes,</hi> where <hi>anguiſh</hi> ſhall be no more. There this corruptible ſhall put on incorruption, and our mortality ſhall be ſwallowed vp of life. Euen ſo be it.</p>

                  <p>I haue now by occaſion of <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the place, from whence God will ſpeake vnto you, exhorted euery one of you in particular to come to the Church. I pray you note

                     <hi>The top of Carmel]</hi> There were two hils of this name, as <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Hierome</hi> teacheth; both in <hi>Iudea;</hi> the one in the ſoutherne cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of that country where on <hi>Nabal</hi> the husband of <hi>Abigail</hi> did dwell, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.2. the other neere vnto <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſea coaſt, vpon which <hi>Elias</hi> prayed for raine, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.42. <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Hierome</hi> ſeemeth to doubt; which of theſe two <hi>Carmels</hi> our prophet here intendeth.

                  <p>This <hi>Carmel</hi> was a hill of much fatneſſe, and fertilitie: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it may, as proverbially, be taken for any ſuch place. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                     <hi>Hebrician</hi> of like note, affirmeth that becauſe <hi>Carmel</hi> collectiuely ſignifieth ſtanding corne, or new wheat yet in the eare, therfore a certaine region in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of <hi>Canaan</hi> of extraordinary fertility (as alſo a hill, &amp; city there) was called after this name <hi>Carmel.</hi> Whatſoeuer <hi>Carmel</hi> be in this place, whether a proper name, or an appellatiue, out of doubt it betokeneth a place of much fruitfulnes. Following the ſtreame of expoſitors, I am of opinion, that <hi>Carmel</hi> in my text, is that ſame fruitfull mountaine of <hi>Iudea</hi> by <hi>Ptolemais.</hi>

                     <hi>The top of Carmel]</hi> A place fit by reaſon of the woodes there to lurke, and lie hid in; as is plaine by <hi>Amos,</hi> 9.3. <hi>Though they hide themſelues in the top of</hi> Carmel, <hi>I will ſearch, and take them out thence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The top of Carmel]</hi> In the Hebrew it is the <hi>head of Carmel.</hi> The <hi>head,</hi> or <hi>top</hi> of <hi>Carmel,</hi> is the Scripture phraſe, to expreſſe whatſoeuer is beſt in <hi>Carmel.</hi> By the like phraſe we ſay <hi>Caput vnguenti,</hi> the <hi>head</hi> or the <hi>top of the ointment,</hi> to ſignifie the <hi>beſt</hi> of the ointment.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The top of Carmel ſhall wither]</hi> ſhall wax dry, or be dried vp. That is, where moſt fruitfull fields, and paſtures are, there ſhall be a defect, and want of neceſſaries for mans life.</p>
                  <p>Thus haue you the expoſition of this laſt clauſe. Now bee patient, I pray you, while from hence I commend one leſſon vnto you. It is this:
<q>For the ſinnes of a people, God will make the top of their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel to wither.</q> I ſpeake it more plainly.</p>
                  <q>For the ſinnes of a people, God will make. their beſt grounds to yeeld them little, or no profit.</q>

                  <p>For proofe of this point, you will bee pleaſed to heare the euidence of the holy Spirit, giuen in the word of life, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.20. Thus ſaith the <hi>Lord: becauſe of the wickedneſſe of thy workes, whereby thou haſt forſaken mee, the Lord ſhall ſmite thee with blaſting, and with mildew: the Heauen which is ouer thy head ſhall bee braſſe, and the earth that is vnder thee, ſhall bee iron: in ſtead of raine, the Lord ſhall giue thee duſt and aſhes, euen from heauen ſhall it come downe vpon thee vntill thou be deſtroyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the 2 chapter of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> and the 5 verſe, becauſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> had plaid the harlot, and done ſhamefully, departing from the <hi>Lord,</hi> thus ſaith the <hi>Lord: I will take away from Iſrael my corne in the time thereof, and my wine in the ſeaſon thereof, &amp; wil recouer my wooll, &amp; my flax, which I lent her, to couer her ſhame.</hi> Marke I beſeech you, the manner of the <hi>Lords</hi> ſpeech, <hi>my corne, my wine, my wooll, my flax;</hi> they are none of ours, they are all the Lords.

                  <p>In the 4. Chapter of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> and the 3. verſe, becauſe there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land; but euery on breaketh out by <hi>ſwearing,</hi> by <hi>lying,</hi> by <hi>killing,</hi> by <hi>ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> by <hi>whoring,</hi> and blood toucheth blood, thus ſaith the <hi>Lord: the land ſhall mourne, and euery one that dwelleth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhall be cut off, with the beaſts of the field, and with the fowles of heauen, and alſo the fiſhes of the ſea ſhal be taken away.</hi> If ſo, what good then comes to you from <hi>Carmel,</hi> from your beſt &amp; moſt fruitfull grounds?</p>
                  <p>In the 8. chapter of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> and the 7. verſe, becauſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> tranſgreſſing the couenant of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and treſpaſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his law, <hi>had ſowen the wind,</hi> thus ſaith the <hi>Lord: they ſhall reape the whirlewind: it hath no ſtalke;</hi> the <hi>bud ſhall bring forth no meale; if ſo be it bring forth, the ſtrangers ſhal deuoure it.</hi> If ſo, what profit then can we, matching <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their moſt grieuous tranſgreſſions, &amp; treſpaſſes, expect from <hi>Carmel,</hi> our moſt fruitfull, and pleaſant fields?</p>
                  <p>The wiſeſt <hi>King</hi> that euer ſacred writ made mention of, hath

                  <p>To make an end of this diſcourſe, I would I could write it in your harts, what the ſweeteſt ſinger, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 107.34. deliuereth vnto you, touching this point: it is worthy your beſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance: <hi>A fruitfull land God turneth into barrennes, for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of them that dwell therein.</hi> This one place (had I trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled you with no more) would haue been a pregnant, and ſufficient proofe of my propounded doctrine.

You muſt then acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the leſſon commended vnto you to be good, and true; namely, that <hi>for the ſinnes of a people, God will make their</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel <hi>to wither;</hi> that for the ſinnes of a people, God will make beſt grounds to yeeld them little, or no profit.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs ſee, what vſe we may make of this doctrine for our further inſtructions.</p>
                  <p>A firſt vſe, is to admoniſh ſuch as doe dwell in delectable, pleaſant, well watred, and fruitfull places, that they boaſt not ouermuch of their fertile, and ſweet poſſeſſions: ſince there is no land ſo <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>A ſecond vſe, is to warne rich men, the richer ſort among you, that weighing rightly the power of Almighty God, by which he maketh the top of <hi>Carmel</hi> to wither, &amp; turneth your <hi>fruitfull</hi> fields into <hi>barrenneſſe;</hi> you will beware of inſolencie, and containe your ſelues in modeſtie, and ſubmiſſion.

The ſcope of the prophecie is <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as I ſhewed in my<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>If <hi>Iſrael</hi> be the ſcope of this prophecie, how commeth it to paſſe, that the Prophet beſtoweth the reſidue of this chapter, and a part of the next, in making rehearſall of foraine nations, their tranſgreſſions, and puniſhments? Why doth he acquaint <hi>Iſrael</hi> with his burdenſome prophecies againſt the <hi>Syrians,</hi> the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> the <hi>Edomites,</hi> the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> the <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites?</hi> why doth he not rather diſcharge his function, and duty laid vpon him? and checke the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> &amp; terrifie them, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1736:35"/> reproue them for their euill deeds?</p>
                  <p>The reaſons why <hi>Amos,</hi> ſent of purpoſe with a meſſage to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> doth firſt prophecie againſt the <hi>Syrians,</hi> &amp; other <hi>forraine nations,</hi> are three.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That he might be the more patiently heard of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſeeing their Prophet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> ſo ſharpe againſt the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and other their enemies, could not, but with more quiet heare him, when he ſhould propheſie againſt them alſo. <hi>Conſolatio quaedam eſt, afflictio ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mici:</hi> ſome comfort it is to a diſtreſſed naturall man, to ſee his enemy in diſtreſſe likewiſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That they might haue no cauſe to wonder, if God ſhould at any time come againſt them in vengeance, ſeeing that God would not ſpare the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and other their neighbour Countries, though they were deſtitute of the light of Gods word, and ignorant of his will.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 That they might the more feare at the words of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, when they ſhould ſee the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and other nations, afflicted, and tormented accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Here might they thus haue argued? Wil not God ſpare our neighbours, the <hi>Syrians,</hi> &amp; the reſt? Then out of doubt he wil not ſpare vs. They ſilly people neuer knew the holy will of God, and yet ſhal they be ſo ſeuerely puniſhed? How then ſhal we eſcape, who knowing Gods holy will haue contemned it?</p>
                  <p>From the reaſons why <hi>Amos</hi> firſt prophecieth againſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine nations, &amp; then againſt the Lords people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> I come now to treat particularly of his prophecy againſt the <hi>Syrians,</hi> verſ. 3, 4, 5.</p>

Hereby you may be perſwaded of the authority of this Prophecie: and not of this only, but of all other the Prophecies of holy Scripture; that neither this, nor any other Prophecies of old, is deſtitute of diuine authority. This point touching the authority of holy Scripture I deliuered vnto you in my ſecond lecture, and therefore haue now the leſſe need to ſpend time therein. Yet a word or two thereof.</p>
                  <p>God almighty ſpake in old ime to our <hi>fathers by the mouth of Moſes, Exod.</hi> 4.12. and not by the mouth of <hi>Moſes</hi> only, but by <hi>the mouths of all his Prophets, Heb.</hi> 1.1. and 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.20. <hi>Know this that no prophecy in the Scripture is of any priuate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> He giueth the reaſon hereof <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>for the prophecy in old time came not by the will of man, but holy men of God ſpake as they were moued by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Hence ſprang thoſe vſuall and familiar ſpeeches in the bookes of the Prophets; <hi>The word of the Lord came vnto me;</hi> the <hi>Lord God hath ſpoken;</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:1736:36"/> and this in my text, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord.</hi> This Lord, who thus ſpake in old time by his <hi>Prophets,</hi> did in fulneſſe of time, when hee ſent to conſummate, and perfect the worke of mans redemption, ſpeake by his bleſſed <hi>Euangeliſts,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This appeareth by the faithfull promiſe made vnto them, Matth. 10.19. <hi>Take no thought how, or what yee ſhall ſpeake; for it ſhall be giuen you, what ye ſhall ſay. It is not yee that ſpeake, but the Spirit of your father, that ſpeaketh in you.</hi> It muſt ſtand euer true what is recorded, 2 Tim. 3.16. the <hi>whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> (and euery parcell thereof) <hi>is giuen by inſpiration of God,</hi> and hath inward witneſſe from that <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all truth.</p>
                  <p>Here may you note the harmonie, conſent, and agreement, of all the Prophets, Euangeliſts, and Apoſtles, from the firſt vnto the laſt: not one of them ſpake one word of a naturall man in all their miniſteries; the words which they ſpake, were the words of him that ſent them: they ſpake not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, God ſpake in them. Whenſoeuer were the <hi>time,</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer were the <hi>meanes,</hi> whoſoeuer were the <hi>man;</hi> whereſoeuer were the <hi>place,</hi> whatſoeuer were the <hi>people,</hi> the words were the <hi>Lords.</hi>

                  <p>

How dare we ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our ſelues from his houſe of prayer, where God in and by his holy word ſpeaketh vnto vs? How dare we, when we are come to this place, behaue our ſelues careleſly, negligently, irreuerently?</p>
                  <p>But I will not at this time preſſe you any further with this point, hauing heretofore in my fourth lecture occaſioned by the Lords <hi>roaring out of Sion,</hi> and <hi>vttering his vowe from Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> exhorted you in many words, to the due performance of your dutifull ſeruice of God in this place. For this preſent, I will onely giue you a taſte of the ſweetneſſe of the word of the <hi>Lord,</hi> conueyed vnto vs by the miniſteries of his ſanctified Prophets, Euangeliſts, &amp; Apoſtles. It is the <hi>Lords</hi> moſt royall and celeſtiall teſtament, the oracles of his heauenly ſanctuary,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1736:37"/> the only key vnto vs of his reuealed counſels; milke from his ſacred breaſts; the earneſt and pledge of his fauour to his Church, the light of our feet, ioy of our hearts, breath of our noſtrils, pillar of our faith, anchor of our hope, ground of our loue, euidences, and deeds of our future bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now let vs ſee what leſſons may bee taken from hence for our further inſtruction, and meditation. Gods diſlike with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus,</hi> for <hi>threſhing Gilead with threſhing inſtruments of yron,</hi> yeeldeth vs this leſſon;
<q>God is neuer well pleaſed with too much crueltie.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This truth will well appeare vnto vs, if we doe but conſider how God hath euermore rewarded cruelty.

                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:1736:43"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Agag</hi> King of the <hi>Amalekites</hi> by his ſword had made many a woman childleſſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.33. but what was his reward? You may ſee in the ſame verſe what <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid, and did vnto him. <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid, <hi>As thy ſword hath made women childleſſe, ſo ſhall thy mother be childleſſe among other women;</hi> and Samuel <hi>hewed</hi> Agag <hi>in peeces before the</hi> Lord <hi>in Gilgal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Babylonians</hi> were wonderfull cruell and hard hearted againſt the inhabitants of <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> they ſpared none of them, no not their young children, but cruelly deſtroyed them, and all theirs. But what was their reward? You may ſee it by the propheticall denuntiation of the ruine of <hi>Babel, Pſal.</hi> 137.8, 9. <hi>O daughter of Babel, worthy to be deſtroyed: bleſſed ſhall he be that rewardeth thee as thou haſt ſerued vs; bleſſed ſhall he be that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and daſheth thy children againſt the ſtones.</hi> This reward of <hi>Babel</hi> is enlarged, <hi>Eſay</hi> 13.16. <hi>Their children ſhall be broken in peeces before their eyes: their houſes ſhall be ſpoiled; and their wiues rauiſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus not to trouble you with many examples, we ſee by the reward of <hi>cruelty</hi> in the examples of <hi>Adonibezek, Agag,</hi> and the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> that God abhorreth it. God abhorreth <hi>cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> howſoeuer he doth puniſh it with another cruelty.

                  <p>The vſe of the doctrine now confirmed, is to work in vs the loue of clemency and mercifulneſſe. When we are well aſſured, that the <hi>cruel</hi> themſelues ſhall taſte of <hi>cruelty</hi> by way of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we will be afraid to behaue our ſelues towards any <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly.</hi> All <hi>cruelty</hi> is checked by the law of God, by the ſixt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt doe no murther;</hi> or <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi>

                  <p>Thus farre haue I beene carried by my firſt doctrine, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon theſe words, <hi>They haue threſhed</hi> Gilead <hi>with threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtruments of iron.</hi> My doctrine was: <hi>God is neuer well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with too much cruelty.</hi> Now be patient, I beſeech you, while vpon the ſame words I ground a ſecond doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They haue threſhed</hi> Gilead <hi>with threſhing inſtruments of iron:] They]</hi> that is, the <hi>Syrians,</hi> Gods enemies, <hi>haue threſhed</hi> Gilead] that is, ſome of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Gods owne people, <hi>with threſhing inſtruments of iron.</hi> The leſſon we learne from hence is;
<q>God often humbleth his ſeruants vnder his foes, and their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This point is notably verified, in <hi>Lot</hi> ſore preſſed vpon by the <hi>Sodomites, Gen.</hi> 19.9. in the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> hardly dealt with by the <hi>Aegyptians, Exod.</hi> 1.11. &amp;c. in the 70. brethren, ſons of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbaal,</hi> perſecuted by <hi>Abimelech,</hi> moſt of them to the death, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 9.5. in <hi>Ieremie</hi> twiſe euill entreated; firſt beaten, and put in the ſtockes by <hi>Paſhure, Ier.</hi> 20.2. and a ſecond time beaten and impriſoned by <hi>Zedechias</hi> his nobles, <hi>Ier.</hi> 37.15.

                  <p>Many more are the examples regiſtred in the booke of God, fit to proue this point: which alſo may further appeare vnto you, in thoſe bloudy perſecutions after Chriſt his death by the Romane Emperours, in thoſe ſtrange torments which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed to keepe downe religion, and religious profeſſors, men &amp; women;<note place="margin">Ler Serm. D. Laurent. Prudent. hymn. in S.

Many more were the grieuous torments endured by
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1736:45"/> the faithfull in the time of the ten firſt perſecutions in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church. All, and euery of which doe ſtrongly proue my doctrine;
<q>God often humbleth his ſeruants vnder his foes, and their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon why God <hi>humbleth his ſeruants,</hi> vnder his, and their enemies, is their diſobedience to his word. This is plaine, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.36, 37. <hi>If thou wilt not obey the voice of the</hi> Lord <hi>thy God, to keep and to doe all his commandements, and his ordinances, the</hi> Lord <hi>ſhall bring thee, and thy king vnto a nation, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou, nor thy fathers haue knowne; and there ſhalt thou ſerue other Gods, wood and ſtone: and thou ſhalt be a wonder, a prouerb, and a common talke among all the people, whither the</hi> Lord <hi>ſhall carry thee.</hi> Where you ſee captiuity, and baniſhment, denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to Gods owne people, if they diſobey his word.</p>

                  <p>The reaſon is, The <hi>diſobedience</hi> of Gods ſeruants to the word of God. The vſes of this doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To ſhew vnto vs how great Gods <hi>anger</hi> is for <hi>ſinne,</hi> that doth puniſh it ſo ſeuerely, euen in his deareſt children. The conſideration hereof ſhould worke in vs a loathing, hatred, and deteſtation of ſin. Yet ſuch is the peruerſity of our corrupt natures, that we daily fleet from <hi>ſin</hi> to <hi>ſin,</hi> like the flie that ſhif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth from ſore to ſore: we tempt the <hi>Lord,</hi> wee murmur, wee luſt, we commit idolatry: we haue our eies full of adultery, our hearts exerciſed with couetouſneſſe, our bodies weakned with drunkenneſſe; by all meanes we ſerue the fleſh, ſitting downe to eat, and riſing to play. Neuer more need than now, to ſmite our breaſts, and pray with the Publicane, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.13. <hi>O God be mercifull vnto vs ſinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To teach vs, not to meaſure the fauour of God towards our ſelues, or others, by the bleſſings, or aduerſities of this life, ſeeing the wicked doe often flouriſh whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the godly are in great miſery: and on the other ſide, the godly doe proſper, when the wicked are in diſtreſſe.</p>

                  <p>In ſpeaking of the <hi>vengeance</hi> of God, our firſt care muſt bee, not to derogate any thing from his procliuitie, and propenſnes vnto <hi>mercy.</hi> We muſt breake out into the mention of <hi>his great goodneſſe,</hi> and ſing a lowd of <hi>his mercies,</hi> as <hi>Dauid</hi> doth, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 145.7. <hi>The Lord is gracious, and mercifull, ſlow to anger; and of great kindneſſe; he is louing, and good to all; his mercy is ouer all his works.</hi> The Lord ſtrong, and mighty, bleſſed aboue all, yea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bleſſedneſſe it ſelfe, and therefore hauing no need of any man, is louing, and good vnto euery man.</p>

                  <p>By <hi>fire</hi> in this place the learned<note n="d" place="margin">Lyranus. Druſius. Ar. Montanus. Mercer. Caluin. Gualter</note> expoſitors doe vnderſtand not only naturall fire, but alſo the <hi>ſword,</hi> and <hi>peſtilence,</hi> and <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; quod libet genus conſumptionis,</hi> euery kind of conſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euery ſcourge, wherewith God puniſheth the wicked, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, be it <hi>haile,</hi> or <hi>thunder,</hi> or <hi>ſicknes,</hi> or any other of Gods meſſengers. So farre is the ſignification of <hi>fire,</hi> though not in the naturall, yet in the Metaphorical vnderſtanding extended. The doctrine which from hence I gather is.</p>
                  <q>As is the fire, ſo are all other creatures at the Lords comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to bee imployed by him in the puniſhment of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</q>
                  <p>This truth well appeareth by that which I euen now repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 39. whence you heard, that <hi>ſome ſpirits are created for vengeance; as alſo are fire, and haile, and famine, and death, and the teeth of wild beaſts, and the ſcorpions, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and the ſword; yea, that the principall things for the whole vſe of mans life, as water, and fire, and yron, and ſalt, and meale, &amp; wheat, and hony, and milke, and the bloud of the grape, and oile, &amp; cloathing, are all for euill vnto the wicked.</hi> If that proofe, becauſe the booke, whence it is taken, is <hi>Apocryphall,</hi> like you not: giue care I pray you, while I proue it out of <hi>Canonicall</hi> Scripture. The doctrine to be proued is.</p>
                  <q>Fire, and all other creatures, are at the Lords commandement to be imploied by him in the puniſhment of the wicked.</q>
                  <p>I proue it by the ſeruice of Angels, and other creatures. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.35. we read of <hi>an hundred fourſcore and fiue thouſand in the camp of</hi> Aſhur <hi>ſlaine by an Angell of the Lord.</hi> The thing is related alſo, <hi>Eſay</hi> 37.36.

                  </p>
                  <p>The ſtory of Gods viſitation vpon <hi>Pharaoh, and</hi> the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> in <hi>Exod. chap.</hi> 8, 9. and 10. is fit for my purpoſe, You ſhall there find, that <hi>frogs, lice, flies, graſhoppers, thunder, haile, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, murraine, botches,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſores,</hi> did inſtrumentally auenge God vpon man and beaſt in <hi>Egypt.</hi> Adde hereto what you read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.8. <hi>fire and haile, and ſnow, and vapours, and ſtormy winds doe execute Gods commandement.</hi> Thus is my doctrine proued,
<q>As is the fire, ſo are all other creatures at the Lords commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be imployed by him in the puniſhment of the wicked.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vſe of this doctrine is to teach vs, how to behaue our ſelues at ſuch times as God ſhall viſit vs with his rod of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, how to carry our ſelues in all our afflictions. We muſt not ſo much looke to the <hi>inſtruments,</hi> as to the <hi>Lord</hi> that ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth by them.</p>
                  <p>Here ſet we before our eyes holy <hi>King Dauid.</hi> His patience! be it the patterne of our Chriſtian imitation. When <hi>Shimei</hi> a man of the family of the houſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> came out againſt him, caſt ſtones at him, and railed vpon him, calling him to his face <hi>a man of blood,</hi> and a <hi>man of Belial,</hi> a <hi>murtherer,</hi> and <hi>a wicked man,</hi> the good <hi>King</hi> did not as he was wiſhed to doe: he took not away the <hi>murtherers</hi> life, but had reſpect to the <hi>primus mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> euen Almighty God, the firſt mouer of this his affliction; <hi>Shimei</hi> he knew was but the <hi>inſtrument.</hi> And therefore thus ſaith he to Abiſchai, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.10. <hi>He curſeth becauſe the</hi> Lord <hi>had bidden him curſe Dauid; and who dare then ſay, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haſt thou done ſo? Suffer him to curſe, for the Lord hath bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here alſo ſet we before our eies holy <hi>Iob.</hi> His <hi>patience!</hi> be it the patterne of our Chriſtian imitation. The loſſe of all his ſubſtance, &amp; his children, by the <hi>Sabeans, Chaldeans, fire</hi> from heauen, and a great <hi>wind</hi> from beyond the wilderneſſe, could not turne away his eies from the God of heauen to thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes. They he knew were but the <hi>inſtruments.</hi> And therefore poſſeſſing his ſoule in patience he ſaid, <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Naked came I out of my mothers wombe, and naked ſhall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1736:50"/> thither: the</hi> Lord <hi>hath giuen, and the</hi> Lord <hi>hath taken: bleſſed be the name of the</hi> Lord.</p>
                  <p>To theſe inſtances of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi> adde one more; that of the bleſſed Apoſtles, <hi>Peter, Iohn,</hi> &amp; the reſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.27. Though <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilate,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and <hi>the people of Iſrael,</hi> had crucified, and done to death the <hi>Lord of life,</hi> our <hi>Lord</hi> and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Yet did not the Apoſtles therefore grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a rage, and bitter ſpeeches againſt them. In that great exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the <hi>Lord Ieſus,</hi> they had regard vnto the hand of God. <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilat,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the <hi>Iewes,</hi> they knew were but <hi>inſtruments.</hi> For thus make they their confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before the <hi>Lord</hi> of heauen and earth, verſe the 28. <hi>Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe both Herod, and Pontius Pilat, with the Gentiles, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſrael, gathered themſelues together againſt thine holy Son Ieſus, to doe whatſoeuer thine hand, and thy counſell had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To good purpoſe then is that queſtion propounded by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos, chap.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Shall there be euill in a city, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> It may ſerue for an anchor to keepe vs, that we be not carried away with the waues of tribulation, and affliction. It aſſureth vs that God, who bad <hi>Shimei</hi> curſe <hi>Dauid,</hi> who ſent the <hi>Sabeans, Chaldeans, fire</hi> from heauen, and a great <hi>wind</hi> from beyond the wilderneſſe, to ſpoile, and make an end of <hi>Iobs</hi> ſubſtance and his children; who determined that <hi>Herod, Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilat,</hi> with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſhould put to death the <hi>Lord of life:</hi> that the <hi>ſame God</hi> hath his <hi>finger,</hi> yea, and his <hi>whole hand</hi> too, in all our croſſes and tribulations. <hi>Is there any euill in the city, and the</hi> Lord <hi>hath not done it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here (beloued in the Lord) muſt we be taxed for <hi>a vanity</hi> at leaſt, (I had almoſt ſaid a <hi>blaſphemie</hi>) deeply rooted, &amp; too well ſetled among vs. Vpon the acceſſe of any calamity we cry out, <hi>bad lucke, bad fortue.</hi> If the ſtrong man come into our houſe, and take from vs the <hi>flower</hi> of our riches, our <hi>ſiluer</hi> and <hi>gold,</hi> then we cry, <hi>What lucke? What fortune?</hi> If our ſheepe and cattell faile vs, then alſo we cry, <hi>What lucke? What fortune?</hi> Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer croſſe befalleth vs, <hi>lucke</hi> and <hi>fortune</hi> is ſtill in our mouths: <hi>Quaſi Deus otium coloret in coelo, &amp; non curaret res humanas;</hi> as
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1736:51"/> if we were to hold it for an article of our beleefe, that <hi>God</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth idly in heauen, and hath no regard of mans affaires.

                     </hi> Lord <hi>hath not done it?</hi> and the holy Apoſtles, in acknowledging Gods hand in the death of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and holy <hi>Iob</hi> in bleſſing the name of the <hi>Lord</hi> for all his loſſes; and holy <hi>Dauid,</hi> in patiently taking <hi>Shimeis</hi> curſes, as an affliction ſent him from the <hi>Lord,</hi> doe all plainly ſhew this, that the empire of this world is adminiſtred by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, &amp; that nothing happeneth vnto vs, but by <hi>Gods hand,</hi> and <hi>appointment.</hi> Learne we then more patience towards the inſtruments of our calamities, miſeries, croſſes, and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: let vs not belike the <hi>dogge,</hi> that ſnatcheth at a ſtone caſt at him, without regard vnto the <hi>thrower.</hi> Here we learne a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter propertie: euen to turne our eies from the inſtrumentes to the hand that ſmiteth by them.

                  <p>My third was; <hi>whom he puniſheth] Hazael</hi> and <hi>Benhadad; the houſe of Hazael, and palaces of Benhadad.</hi> If you will know who this <hi>Hazael</hi> was, you muſt haue recourſe to the ſacret ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 8. There ſhall you find him ſent by <hi>Benhadad,</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> with a preſent vnto <hi>Elizeus</hi> to know concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his ſickneſſe, whether he ſhould recouer of it; and after his returne from <hi>Elizeus,</hi> with a thicke wet cloath to haue ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, and murdered his Lord, and Maſter, King <hi>Benhadad.</hi> This was he, whom <hi>Elizeus</hi> foretold of his hard vſage of the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> that he ſhould <hi>ſet on fire their ſtrong cities;</hi> ſhould <hi>ſlay their young men with the ſword;</hi> ſhould <hi>daſh their infants againſt the ſtones;</hi> and ſhould <hi>rent in peeces their women great with child.</hi> This was he, who 2. <hi>Kings.</hi> 13.7. ſo deſtroyed the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that <hi>hee made them like duſt beaten to powder.</hi> This was he of whoſe death we read verſe the 24.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The houſe of Hazael]</hi> either the familie, ſtocke, and poſterity of <hi>Hazael;</hi> as <hi>Arias Montanus, Mercer, Druſius</hi> expound: or ſome materiall houſe, which <hi>Hazael</hi> had proudly and ſtately built for himſelfe, and his poſteritie.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1736:51"/> of that which followeth, <hi>the palaces of Benhadad.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Benhadad.]</hi> In writing this name, I find three errours. One of the <hi>Greeks</hi> who write <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> as if it were in the Hebrew <hi>Benader.</hi> The ſecond of the <hi>Latines,</hi> who write it <hi>Benhadad.</hi> The third of <hi>Ionathan,</hi> the <hi>Chaldee paraphraſt,</hi> who writes it <hi>Barhadad:</hi> whereas the right name is <hi>Benhadad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Benhadad</hi> (ſaith <hi>Mercer</hi> vpon this place) was a name pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Kings of <hi>Syria;</hi> as was firſt <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and afterward <hi>Ptolemee</hi> to the Kings of Egypt, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> to the Roman Emperours. From this opinion of <hi>Mercer, Druſius in obſeruat. ſacr.</hi> 11.14. varieth, affirming that albeit diuerſe Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> were called by this name <hi>Benhadad,</hi> yet doth it not thereupon follow, that <hi>Benhadad</hi> was a common name to all the Kings of <hi>Syriae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In holy Scripture we reade of three <hi>Benhadads.</hi> Of the firſt 1. <hi>Kings.</hi> 15.18. who was <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> at what time <hi>Aſa</hi> raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Baaſha</hi> in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Of the ſecond, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 8.7. who in his ſickneſſe ſent <hi>Hazael</hi> to <hi>Elizeus</hi> the man of God to counſaile. Of the third 2 <hi>Kings.</hi> 13.3. who was <hi>Hazaels</hi> ſonne, and his ſucceſſour in the throne.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Benhadad</hi> in my text, is either <hi>Benhadad, Hazaels</hi> predeceſſour, ſlaine by <hi>Hazael,</hi> or <hi>Benhadad, Hazaels</hi> ſon, and ſucceſſour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Palaces of Benhadad]</hi> to bee deuoured by <hi>fire</hi> from the <hi>Lord.</hi> Theſe palaces of <hi>Benhadad</hi> are the goodly, ſumptuous, proud, and ſtately edifices made, or enlarged, by either of the <hi>Benhadads,</hi> or by both: <hi>Hazaels</hi> predeceſſour, and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour.</p>
                  <p>Thus haue you the expoſition of my third circumſtance, which was concerning the parties puniſhed; no meane parties parties of no lower ranke then Kings: <hi>Hazael,</hi> and <hi>Benhadad</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> puniſheth, hee puniſheth by <hi>fire;</hi> hee puniſheth by fire <hi>Hazael,</hi> and <hi>Benhadad; I will ſend a fire into the houſe of</hi> Hazael, <hi>and it ſhal deuoure the palaces of</hi> Benhadad. Many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable doctrines may be hence deduced. I can but point at them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 In that the Lord <hi>ſendeth a fire into tho houſe of</hi> Hazael, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1736:52"/> his family, and poſterity, we are put in minde of a truth expreſſed in the ſecond commandement; this:
<q>God will viſit the ſinnes of the fathers vpon the children vnto the third and fourth generation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dearely beloued; ſore is that anger, the flame of whoſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment caſteth out ſmoake ſo farre: yet the meaning thereof is, as <hi>Ezechiel</hi> ſheweth, <hi>chap.</hi> 18. <hi>If the children doe follow the fathers wickedneſſe,</hi> and not otherwiſe. To <hi>viſit</hi> then, is not to puniſh the children for the fathers offences, but to take notice, and apprehend them in the ſame faults, by reaſon they are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ouer to commit their fathers tranſgreſſions, that for them they be puniſhed.</p>
                  <p>The vſe is, to admoniſh you that are Parents, not onely to liue your ſelues vertuouſly, and religiouſly, while you haue your abode here, but alſo carefully to ſee to the training vp of your children, in vertue, and true religion, leaſt pertaking with your in your ſins, they proue inheritours of your puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alſo.</p>

                  <q>It is neither wealth, nor policie, nor power, nor preferment, that can ſtead vs, if Gods vnappeaſeable anger break out againſt vs for our ſinnes.</q>
                  <p>The reaſon hereof we read, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 4.4. It's this: <hi>Becauſe of the wickedneſſe of our inuentions, Gods wrath comes forth like fire, and burneth that none can quench it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vſe is to teach vs, that wee deſpiſe not <hi>Gods iudgments,</hi> nor abuſe his <hi>mercies;</hi> but that we tremble at the one, and bee drawne to well doing by the other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 In that the <hi>Lord ſendeth a fire</hi> into the <hi>palaces</hi> of <hi>Benha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad,</hi> to deuoure them: we learne thus much.</p>
                  <q>God depriueth vs of a great bleſſing, when hee taketh from vs our dwelling houſes.</q>
                  <p>The great commoditie, or contentment, that commeth to euery one of vs by our dwelling houſes, doth experimentally make good vnto vs this truth.</p>
                  <p>The vſe is; to teach vs, firſt, to be humbled before Almighty
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1736:52"/> God, whenſoeuer our <hi>dwelling houſes</hi> are taken from vs. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſince we peaceably enioy our <hi>dwelling houſes,</hi> to vſe them for the furtherance of Gods glory.

                  <p>Theſe few now alleaged inſtances doe ſufficiently (though briefly) confirme my propounded doctrine;
<q>There is no thing, nor creature, able to withſtand Gods power, or to let his purpoſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon hereof is, becauſe God only is <hi>omnipotent,</hi> and whatſoeuer elſe is in the world, it is weake, and <hi>vnable to reſiſt.</hi> Of Gods <hi>omnipotency</hi> we make our daily profeſſion in the firſt article of our beleefe, profeſſing him to be <hi>God, the Father Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</hi> In which profeſſion wee doe not exclude, either the <hi>Sonne,</hi> or <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> from <hi>omnipotency.</hi> For God the Father, who imparteth his Godhead vnto the <hi>Sonne,</hi> and to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> doth communicate the proprieties of his <hi>Godhead</hi> to them alſo. And therefore our beleefe is, that as the Father is <hi>Almighty,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Symbolo Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſ.</note> ſo the Sonne is <hi>Almighty,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is <hi>Almighty</hi> too.</p>
                  <p>Now God is ſaid to be <hi>omnipotent,</hi> or <hi>Almighty,</hi> in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1736:56"/> Firſt, becauſe <hi>he is able to doe whatſoeuer he will.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe <hi>he is able to doe more than he will.</hi> For the firſt, that <hi>God is able to doe whatſoeuer he will,</hi> who but the man poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the ſpirit of Atheiſme, and infidelity dares deny? This truth being expreſly deliuered twiſe in the booke of Pſalmes; Firſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.3. <hi>Our God in heauen, doth whatſoeuer he will:</hi> againe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135.6. <hi>Whatſoeuer pleaſeth the Lord, that doth he in heauen, in earth, in the ſea, in all the depths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, that <hi>God is able to doe more than he will doe:</hi> euery Chriſtian acquainted with the Euangelicall ſtory, doth acknowledge it. It is plaine by <hi>Iohn Baptiſts</hi> reproofe of the Phariſees, and Sadduces, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Thinke not to ſay within your ſelues, we haue</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father; for I ſay vnto you, that God is able of theſe ſtones to raiſe vp children vnto Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. Able,</hi> but <hi>will not.</hi> So likewiſe when <hi>Chriſt</hi> was betrayed, the ſtory, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.53. is, that <hi>God the Father could haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him more than twelue legions of Angels to haue deliuered him.</hi> He <hi>could,</hi> but <hi>would not.</hi> The like may bee ſaid of many other things. The Father was <hi>able</hi> to haue created another world; yea a thouſand worlds. Was <hi>able,</hi> but <hi>would not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee for Gods <hi>omnipotency,</hi> that he is <hi>able to doe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he will doe;</hi> yea that he is <hi>able to doe more than he will doe.</hi> God only is <hi>omnipotent:</hi> whatſoeuer elſe is in the world, its <hi>weake,</hi> and <hi>vnable to reſiſt:</hi> which is the very ſumme of my doctrine already propounded, and confirmed;
<q>There is no thing, nor creature, able to withſtand Gods power, or to let his purpoſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, <hi>chap.</hi> 9.13. <hi>The moſt mighty helps doe ſtoope vnder Gods anger.</hi> This is it, which <hi>Nabuchodonoſor, Dan.</hi> 4.34, 35. confeſſeth: <hi>In compariſon of the moſt high, who liueth for euer, whoſe power is an euerlaſting power, whoſe kingdome is from generation to generation; all the inhabitants of the earth are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted as nothing; according to his will he worketh in the army of heauen, and in the inhabitants of the earth; and none can ſtay his hand, nor ſay vnto him, what doeſt thou?</hi> This is it whereat <hi>S. Paul</hi> aimeth in his queſtion demanded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.19. <hi>Who hath reſiſted the will of God?</hi> And this is it which <hi>Iob</hi> intendeth, <hi>chap.</hi> 9.4.

                  <p>I omit many like places of holy writ; and commend vnto you, but one more, parallel to this in my text. It is in the 3. <hi>ver.</hi> of the 2. <hi>chap.</hi> of this prophecie. There thus ſaith the <hi>Lord; I wil cut off the Iudge out of the midſt of</hi> Moab; as here in my text, <hi>I will cut off the inhabitant of</hi> Bikeath-Auen; and <hi>verſ.</hi> the 8. <hi>I will cut off the inhabitant from</hi> Aſhdod. <hi>I will cut off,</hi> whether <hi>the Iudge out of the middeſt of</hi> Moab; or <hi>the inhabitant from</hi> Aſhdod;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1736:60"/> or <hi>the inhabitant of</hi> Bikeath-Auen, the meaning is one, and the ſame: <hi>I will cut off,</hi> that is, I will vtterly deſtroy, or extinguiſh.</p>
                  <p>Which to be the meaning of the word, the author of the <hi>Vulgar Latine</hi> acknowledgeth, tranſlating the word in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, not <hi>exeindam</hi> (as indeed it ſignifieth) <hi>I will cut off,</hi> but <hi>diſperdam, I will deſtroy.</hi> So doe the Seuenty Interpreters in their Greeke edition of the Bible, here tranſlating the Hebrew word not <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>Let vs ſee the truth of this in a few inſtances. In <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.6. it is ſaid; when <hi>Aaron</hi> ſtretched out his hand vpon the waters of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that then the <hi>frogge</hi> came vp, and couered the land. The <hi>frogge!</hi> It were ſenſeleſſe to thinke that <hi>one frogge</hi> could couer the land of Egypt; and therefore by the <hi>frogge,</hi> we are to vnderſtand <hi>many frogges.</hi> In <hi>Num.</hi> 21.7. the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> deſired <hi>Moſes</hi> to pray to the <hi>Lord,</hi> that he would take away from them the <hi>Serpent. The Serpent!</hi> what? but one? It is out of doubt that the people meant all the <hi>fiery ſerpents</hi> ſent among them by the <hi>Lord,</hi> to ſting them to death: of which we read, verſe the 6. <hi>Ieremy</hi> in <hi>chap.</hi> 8.7. ſaith that the <hi>ſtorke,</hi> the <hi>turtle,</hi> the <hi>crane,</hi> and the <hi>ſwallow</hi> doe know, and obſerue their appointed times. The <hi>ſtorke,</hi> the <hi>turtle,</hi> the <hi>crane,</hi> the <hi>ſwallow!</hi> We may not think the Prophet ſingleth out <hi>one ſtorke, one turtle, one crane, one ſwallow,</hi> from the reſt; but his meaning is of all <hi>ſtorkes, turtles, cranes, ſwallowes,</hi> that they know, and obſerue their appointed times. As in the now cited places, ſo here in my text, the holy Ghoſt vſeth one number, for another; the <hi>ſingular</hi> for the <hi>plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> vnderſtanding by <hi>one inhabitant, all the inhabitants</hi> of <hi>Bikeath-Auen.</hi>

And our Engliſh <hi>Geneua Tranſlation</hi> draweth vs to bee of the ſame minde, that <hi>Bikeath-Auen</hi> is a proper name of a city in <hi>Syria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame opinion muſt we hold of <hi>Beth-Eden,</hi> in the next clauſe; that it is a proper name of a city in <hi>Syria:</hi> of which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I finde <hi>Mercer,</hi> and <hi>Druſius,</hi> and our Engliſh <hi>Tranſlators at Geneua</hi> to haue beene.

                  </p>
                  <p>The author of the Vulgar Latine takes <hi>Beth-Eden</hi> for an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellatiue, and tranſlates it, <hi>the houſe of pleaſure.</hi> Such indeed is the ſignification of the word; and it is by <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> and <hi>Ribera,</hi> applied to ſignifie the <hi>city of Damaſcus:</hi> as if <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> were there called not only <hi>Bikeath-Auen,</hi> that is, the <hi>field of the Idoll,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Idolatry</hi> there vſed, but alſo <hi>Beth-Eden,</hi> that is, <hi>the houſe of pleaſure,</hi> becauſe of the pleaſant ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation thereof.

In <hi>Eſa.</hi> 43.13. thus ſaith the <hi>Lord; Yea, before the day was, I am, and there is none that can deliuer out of mine hand, I will doe it, and who ſhall let it?</hi> Agreeable to this are the words of our <hi>Sauiour, Ioh.</hi> 5.17. <hi>My father worketh hitherto, and I worke.</hi> From both theſe places wee may truly inferre that God <hi>worketh</hi> in the gouernment of this world day after day, euen vntill the end thereof: which Saint <hi>Paul, Epheſ</hi> 1.11. auoweth; <hi>He worketh all things after the counſell of his owne will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the conſideration hereof <hi>Elihu</hi> ſtirreth vp afflicted <hi>Iob, Chap.</hi> 37. wiſhing him to conſider the wonderous workes of God, the Clouds, and his light ſhining out of them; the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Gods maruellous and glorious voice; the ſnow, the froſt, the whirlewind, the raine; all theſe God ruleth, and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth after his good pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>And who I pray you ruleth man, and mans affaires, but the <hi>Lord? O Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ierem. chap.</hi> 10.23. <hi>I know that the way of man is not in himſelfe, neither is it in man to walke, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his ſteps.</hi> King <hi>Salomon</hi> confeſſeth as much, <hi>Prou.</hi> 20.24. <hi>The ſteps of man are ruled by the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this ruling prouidence of God, King <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 23.1. drew vnto himſelfe a very comfortable argument: <hi>The</hi> Lord <hi>feedeth me, therefore I ſhall not want.</hi> Let vs as comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably reaſon with our ſelues; <hi>The</hi> Lord <hi>feedeth vs, therefore we ſhall not want.</hi> It is ſpoken to our neuer ending comfort by our bleſſed <hi>Sauiour, Matth.</hi> 10.29. <hi>Are not two ſparrowes ſold for a farthing, and one of them falleth not on the ground without your father? Feare ye not therefore, ye are of more value than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſparrowes.</hi> In the ſame place he further aſſureth, that <hi>all the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1736:63"/> haires of our head are numbred.</hi> Doth Gods care reach to the <hi>falling of the haires of our head,</hi> and can we doubt of his perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall rule and gouernment in the world? It muſt ſtand true: Almighty God for his vnlimited power gouerneth all things in the world, and ruleth them <hi>pro libertate voluntatis ſuae,</hi> euen as he liſteth.</p>
                  <p>The third degree, by which we may diſcerne the act of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine prouidence, I called <hi>gradum ordinationis,</hi> the degree of <hi>ordination,</hi> or <hi>direction.</hi> It implyeth thus much: that <hi>God of his admirable wiſdome ordaineth, and ſetteth in order, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer things in the world ſeem to be moſt out of order; he bringeth them all to his chiefly intended end; all muſt make for his glorie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this <hi>diuine ordination</hi> three things doe concurre: <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutio finis; mediorum ad finem diſpoſitio;</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſitorum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectio.</hi> Firſt, God <hi>appointeth an end</hi> to euery thing; ſecondly, he <hi>diſpoſeth meanes vnto the end;</hi> thirdly, hee <hi>directeth the meanes ſo diſpoſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To diſcourſe of theſe particulars ſeuerally, would carry mee beyond my time, and your patience: I will but only touch the generall, which was,
<q>God of his admirable wiſdome ordaineth, or ſetteth in order; whatſoeuer things in the world ſeeme to be moſt out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: he bringeth them all to his chiefly intended end; they all make for his glory.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereupon dependeth the truth of my propounded doctrine inuiolable;
<q>No calamitie or miſerie be falleth any one, of whatſoeuer eſtate or degree, by chance, or at aduenture.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For if it be true, (as true it is, and the gates of Hell ſhall neur be able to preuaile againſt it) that God by his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prouidence, maintaineth, and preſerueth, ruleth, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth, ordereth, diſpoſeth, and directeth all things in this world, euen to the very haires of our heads, it cannot be, that any calamity, or miſery ſhould befall any one of vs by aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by hap-hazard, by chance, by fortune.</p>
                  <p>The Epicure in the booke of <hi>Iob,</hi> 22.13. was in a foule er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to thinke, that God walking in the circle of heauen, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1736:63"/> 
                     <hi>through the darke clouds</hi> ſee our miſdoings, and <hi>iudge</hi> vs for them. Dearely beloued, we may not thinke our God to be a<note n="m" place="margin">See Lect. 1. page 10.</note> God to halfes, and in part only: a God aboue, and not beneath the moone: a God vpon the mountaines, and not in the vallies; a God in the greater, and not in the leſſer em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. We may not thus thinke.</p>
                  <p>We haue liued long enough, to haue learned better things out of <hi>Amos</hi> 9. <hi>Ierem</hi> 23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. that God is euery where preſent, and that there is no euaſion from him.<note place="margin">Serm <hi>4.</hi> in Iames <hi>4.10.</hi> &amp; infra Lect. <hi>14.</hi> pag. <hi>159.</hi>
                     </note> No corner in Hell, no manſion in heauen, no caue in the top of <hi>Carmel,</hi> no fiſhes belly in the bottome of the ſea, no darke dungeon in the land of captiuitie, no place of any ſecrecie any where, is able to hide vs from the preſence of God.</p>
                  <p>Wee haue learned, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.10. that God hath ſeuen eyes, which goe thorow the whole world. You may interpret them with me, many millions of <hi>eyes.</hi> He is<note n="*" place="margin">Hieronymus in illud Pſal. <hi>94.9.</hi> Qui plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauit aurem, non audiet? aut qui finxit oculum non conſiderat? Ego autem dico, quod Deus totus Oculus eſt, totus Manus eſt, totus Pes eſt. Totus Oculus eſt, quia omnia videt. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Manus eſt, quia omnia ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur. Totus Pes eſt, quia vbique eſt.</note> 
                     <hi>totus</hi> OCVLVS, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together <hi>eye,</hi> for he ſeeth all things. We haue learned, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 40.12. that God hath hands <hi>to meaſure the waters, and to ſpan the heauens.</hi> You may interpret it with me, that he hath many millions of <hi>hands:</hi> He is <hi>totus Manus,</hi> altogether <hi>hand;</hi> for he <hi>worketh</hi> all things. We haue learned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.35. that God hath <hi>feet to ſet vpon his foot-ſtoole.</hi> You may interpret it with me, that he hath many milions of <hi>feet:</hi> He is <hi>totus Pes,</hi> altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>foot,</hi> for he <hi>is euery where.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſhall then be very iniurious to God, if we deny him the ouerſight of the ſmalleſt matters. The holy Scriptures doe eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhew, that he examineth the leaſt moments, and tittles in the world that we can imagine,<note n="n" place="margin">Supra pag. <hi>10.</hi>
                     </note> to a handfull of meale, to a cruſe of oyle in a poore widowes houſe, to the falling of ſparrowes to the ground, to the clothing of the graſſe in the field, to the feeding of the birds of the aire, to the caluing of hindes, to the numbring of the haires of our heads.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore (dearely beloued in the Lord) whatſoeuer cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity or miſery hath already ſeized vpon vs, or ſhall hereafter ouertake vs, let vs not lay it vpon <hi>blinde Fortune,</hi> but looke we to the hand that ſtriketh vs. Hee, who is noted in my text <hi>to cut off the inhabitant of</hi> Bikeath-Auen, <hi>and him that holdeth the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1736:64"/> ſcepter out of</hi> Beth-eden, euen He it is, that for our ſins brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vpon vs calamities, and miſeries.</p>
                  <p>The late fearefull floud, raging vpon this land to the vtter deſtruction of great ſtore of cattell, and much people; and the late rot of ſheepe in this, and other places of this land, are Gods viſitations vpon vs for our ſinnes, and admoniſhments for vs to amend our liues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shall there be euill in a city, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> ſaith <hi>Amos, chap.</hi> 3.6. Its out of queſtion; there is no euill in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, no, not in the world, but the <hi>Lords</hi> finger is in it; and that iuſtly, for our ſinnes ſake.</p>
                  <p>What remaineth, but that we rent our hearts, and turne vnto the Lord our God? He is gracious, mercifull, ſlow to anger, of great kindneſſe, and repenteth him of euill. How know we, whether he will returne, and repent, and leaue a bleſſing behinde him for vs? Let vs therefore goe boldly vnto the throne of grace, that wee may receiue mercy, and finde grace to helpe in time of need.</p>

                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This third circumſtance is amplified by the place. Their captiuity, bondage, and ſlauery, was to be in an vnknowne, ſtrange, and farre country; <hi>Kir</hi> in <hi>Media.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the firſt circumſtance of the puniſher, the <hi>Lord</hi> of hoſts imploying in his ſeruice the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> for the carrying away of the <hi>Aramites,</hi> or <hi>Syrians,</hi> into captiuity, we are put in minde of a well knowne truth in diuinity:

                  <p>I ſay <hi>ordinarily:</hi> becauſe <hi>extraordinarily,</hi> he worketh ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time <hi>without meanes,</hi> ſometime <hi>againſt meanes. Ordinarily</hi> he worketh by <hi>meanes.</hi> And they are of two ſorts.</p>

                     <hi>Definite;</hi> ſuch as of their naturall, and internall principles, doe of neceſſity produce ſome certaine effects. So the fire bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, the water drowneth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Indefinite;</hi> ſuch as are free, and accidentall agents, hauing in themſelues freedome of will to doe, or not to doe.</p>
                  <p>In this ranke you may place <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren, at what time they <hi>ſold</hi> him to the <hi>Iſmaelites, Gen.</hi> 37.28. they <hi>ſold</hi> him not of neceſſity, they might haue done otherwiſe. In this ranke you may place <hi>Shimei,</hi> for his carriage towards King <hi>Dauid,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.6. His <hi>throwing of ſtones</hi> at the King, and <hi>railing</hi> vpon him, was not of neceſſitie; he might haue done otherwiſe. And the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> carried into captiuitie this <hi>people of Aram,</hi> not of neceſſity; hee might haue left vnto them their natiue country, lands, and poſſeſſions.</p>
                  <p>All theſe; <hi>fire, water, Ioſephs brethren, rayling Shimei,</hi> the <hi>King of Aſſyria,</hi> and whatſoeuer elſe like theſe, <hi>meanes,</hi> or <hi>ſecond cauſes; definite,</hi> or <hi>indefinite; neceſſary,</hi> or <hi>contingent;</hi> are but <hi>inſtruments,</hi> by which Almighty God in his gouernment of the world worketh <hi>ordinarily.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God laid waſte <hi>Sodome, Gomorrah,</hi> and their ſiſter Cities: he
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:1736:66"/> did it by <hi>fire, Gen.</hi> 19.24. God deſtroyed euery thing that was vpon the earth from man to beaſt, to the creeping thing, and to the fowle of the heauen (onely was <hi>Noah</hi> ſaued, and they that were with him in the Arke) the reſt he deſtroyed by <hi>water, Gen.</hi> 7.23. God ſent <hi>Ioſeph</hi> into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to preſerue his fathers poſterity, and to ſaue them aliue by a <hi>great deliuerance,</hi> as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.7. This was <hi>Gods doing,</hi> but he did it by <hi>Ioſephs</hi> owne brethren, who (you know) <hi>ſold</hi> him to the <hi>Iſmaelites.</hi> God ſent an affliction vpon <hi>Dauid</hi> for his good, by <hi>curſed ſpeaking,</hi> and <hi>throwing of ſtones;</hi> wherein <hi>Dauid</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth <hi>Gods</hi> ſpeciall <hi>finger,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.11. The thing was <hi>Gods</hi> doing. He did it by <hi>Shimei,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iemini. God</hi> ſpake the word concerning the people of <hi>Aram,</hi> that they ſhould <hi>go into captiuity,</hi> as appeareth in my text: <hi>God</hi> ſpake the word, and it was done. <hi>God</hi> therefore ſent the <hi>people of</hi> Aram <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to captiuity,</hi> but he did it by <hi>Tiglath-Pileſer,</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe; (though I ſaid it before, I ſay it againe) All theſe; <hi>fire, water, Ioſephs brethren, rayling Shimei,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and whatſoeuer elſe like theſe, <hi>meanes,</hi> or <hi>ſecond cauſes; definite,</hi> or <hi>indefinite; neceſſary,</hi> or <hi>contingent;</hi> are but inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by which Almightie <hi>God</hi> in his gouernment of the world <hi>ordinarily</hi> worketh.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine of Almightie God, working <hi>ordinarily</hi> by <hi>meanes,</hi> may ſerue to our vſe ſundry wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It may moue vs to a due conſideration of that abſolute right, and power, which <hi>God</hi> holdeth ouer all his creatures. This truth I haue heretofore deliuered vnto you in my eighth Lecture vpon this Prophecie, in this propoſition: <hi>At is the fire, ſo are all other creatures at the Lords commandement, to be imployed by him in the puniſhment of the wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 It may teach vs, that <hi>God</hi> hath a louing regard, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to our <hi>infirmities,</hi> as well knowing, (for he knoweth all things) that in doubtfull matters we vſe often to looke backe, and to haue recourſe to <hi>meanes,</hi> or <hi>ſecond cauſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 It may moue vs to obedience, and thankfulneſſe: that we contemne not the <hi>meanes,</hi> or <hi>ſecond cauſes,</hi> by which God worketh; for this were to tempt God; but that we thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1736:67"/> embrace them, and commit their iſſue, euent, and ſucceſſe to God, that worketh by them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 It meeteth with a peruerſe opinion of ſuch, as doe hold that all <hi>ſecond cauſes</hi> are needleſſe, and vnprofitable, becauſe God by his <hi>particular prouidence</hi> directeth, and bringeth to paſſe all things in the world.</p>
                  <p>Thus will theſe men reaſon: If it be determined by <hi>Gods prouidence,</hi> that I ſhall recouer my health, there is no need that I vſe <hi>Phyſick:</hi> and if it be otherwiſe determined, that I ſhall not recouer, in vaine alſo ſhall I vſe the helpe of <hi>Phyſick.</hi> Againe, if it be determined that <hi>theeues</hi> ſhall haue no power ouer me, I ſhall eſcape from out the middeſt of many: but if it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe determined, that I ſhall be ſpoiled by them, I ſhall not eſcape them, no, though I be in mine owne houſe. Great is the iniury which theſe diſputers doe offer vnto God.</p>
                  <p>For anſwer to them, I muſt grant, that God hath a very ſpeciall care ouer vs, to defend vs; and that we are no time ſafe, but by his <hi>prouidence;</hi> but meane while, to make vs well aſſured of his good will towards vs, he hath ordained <hi>ſecond cauſes,</hi> and <hi>meanes</hi> for vs, at all opportunities, and times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to vſe, in which, and by which, it pleaſeth his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Maieſtie to worke effectually.</p>
                  <p>The rule in diuinity is good, <hi>Poſit â prouidentiâ particulari, non tolluntur de medio omnes cauſae ſecundae:</hi> It is not neceſſarie, that the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>principall cauſe</hi> being put, the <hi>ſecond</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall cauſe</hi> ſhould be remoued, and taken away. The <hi>Sun</hi> doth not in vaine daily riſe, and ſet, though God createth light, and darkneſſe; the <hi>fields</hi> are not in vaine ſowed, and watred with raine, though God bringeth forth the corne out of the earth; our <hi>bodies</hi> are not in vaine with food refreſhed, though God be the life, and length of our dayes.

                  <p>Theſe meanes vnto eternall life are of two ſorts: 1.

                  <p>Thus farre occaſioned by my firſt circumſtance, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the <hi>puniſher;</hi> God by the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> ſent into <hi>captiuitie the people of</hi> Aram. My doctrine was,
<q>Almightie God in his gouernment of the world worketh ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily by meanes, or ſecond cauſes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond circumſtance is of the <hi>puniſhed:</hi> the <hi>Aramites</hi> of all ſorts, the ruder, &amp; the noble. <hi>The people of Aram.</hi> To ground ſome doctrine hereon, you muſt note with me the quality, and condition of theſe <hi>Aramites.</hi> They were profeſſed enemies to the people of God. This appeareth before in the third verſe,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1736:68"/> where they are noted, to haue exerciſed moſt barbarous cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie againſt the <hi>Gileadites,</hi> a parcell of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to <hi>haue threſhed them with threſhing inſtruments of Iron.</hi> Theſe <hi>Aramites,</hi> or <hi>Syrians,</hi> for ſo highly offending, God ſendeth into captiuity. The doctrine is,
<q>Though the Lord doe vſe his enemies, as inſtruments, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his owne ſeruants, and children; yet will he in his due time, ouerthrow thoſe his enemies, with a large meaſure of his iudgements.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Gods holy practice in this kinde, ſpecially regiſtred in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places of his eternall Word, moſt euidently declareth this truth. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were kept in thraldome, and bondage, many yeares by the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> The <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> they were but the weapons of Gods wrath, wherewith he afflicted his people; they were Gods weapons: were they therefore to eſcape vnpuniſhed? No. Witneſſe thoſe <hi>ten great plagues,</hi> which at length God wrought vpon them, and their fearefull ouerthrow in the red ſea, at large ſet downe in the booke of <hi>Exodus,</hi> from the ſeuenth Chapter to the end of the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth. This was it, which God ſaid vnto <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 15.13, 14. <hi>Know for a ſurety, that thy ſeed ſhall be a ſtranger in a Land, that is not theirs, foure hundred yeares, and ſhall ſerue them, and they ſhall intreat them euill; notwithſtanding the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whom they ſhall ſerue, will I iudge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ahab,</hi> the moſt wicked of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who ſold himſelfe to worke wickedneſſe in the ſight of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and his accurſed wife, <hi>Iezebel,</hi> were Gods <hi>inſtruments</hi> to afflict <hi>Naboth</hi> with the loſſe of his life, and Vineyard. <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Iezebel,</hi> were Gods <hi>inſtruments.</hi> Were they therefore to eſcape vnpuniſhed? No. Witneſſe both their ends: the end of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab,</hi> recorded, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22 38. <hi>In the place, where dogges licked the bloud of</hi> Naboth, <hi>did dogges licke the bloud of</hi> Ahab <hi>alſo;</hi> and the end of <hi>Iezabel,</hi> regiſtred the 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.35. <hi>Shee was eaten vp with dogges, all, ſauing her skull, her feet, and the palmes of her hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was a part of <hi>Daniel</hi> his afflictions to be caſt into the den of Lions. His accuſers vnto <hi>Darius</hi> were the <hi>inſtruments</hi> of his
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1736:68"/> affliction. Theſe his accuſers were the <hi>Lords inſtruments</hi> for this buſineſſe. Were they therefore to eſcape vnpuniſhed? No. Their fearefull end is ſet downe, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.24. <hi>By the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of King</hi> Darius <hi>they, with their wiues, and children, were caſt into the den of Lions, the Lions had the maſtery of them, and brake all their bones in peeces, ere euer they came to the ground of the den.</hi>

<q>Though the Lord doe vſe his enemies, as inſtruments, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his owne ſeruants, and children; yet will he in his due time, ouerthrow thoſe his enemies, with a large meaſure of his iudgements.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon hereof is; becauſe Gods iuſtice cannot let them eſcape vnpuniſhed. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth it, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.6. <hi>It is a righteous thing with God to recompence tribulation to them that trouble you.</hi> Let this be our comfort, whenſoeuer the wicked ſhall rage againſt vs. For hereby are we aſſured, when the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhall ſhew himſelfe from heauen with his mightie Angells in flaming fire, that then to the <hi>wicked,</hi> whoſe behauiour towards the godly is proud, and deſpiteous, he will <hi>render vengeance,</hi> and <hi>puniſh</hi> them with <hi>euerlaſting perdition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to make vs ſtedfaſt in this comfort, diſputeth this point, <hi>Ep.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.17. The point he proueth by an argument drawne <hi>à minori,</hi> inferring from a truth to carnall mens vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding leſſe probable, a truth of greater probabilitie. <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>beginneth at the houſe of God; If it firſt begin at vs, what ſhall be the end of them, which obey not the Goſpell of God? And if the righteous ſcarſly be ſaued, where ſhall the vngodly, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1736:69"/> the ſinner appeare?</hi> Our Sauiours words, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.31. doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a like argument: <hi>If they doe theſe things to a greene tree, what ſhall he done to the dry?</hi> To like purpoſe in <hi>Ierem.</hi> 25.29. ſaith the <hi>Lord</hi> of Hoaſts: <hi>Loe I begin to plague the city where my name is called vpon, and ſhall you goe free? Yee ſhall not goe free.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto I referre alſo one other text, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 10.12. where it is ſaid, that God, when he hath done, and diſpatched all his worke vpon <hi>Mount Sion, will viſit the fruit of the proud heart of the King of Aſſyria;</hi> the meaning of the place is, that God, when he hath ſufficiently chaſtiſed and corrected thoſe of his owne houſe, his beloued children, will turne his ſword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſcorners of his Maieſtie. When God hath ſerued his owne turne by the <hi>wicked,</hi> then comes their turne alſo; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer for a while they flouriſh, in hope to eſcape Gods hand, and to abide vnpuniſhed, yet will God in due time well enough finde them out, to pay them double.</p>
                  <p>The vſes of this doctrine I can but point at. One is, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh vs, that we ſpite not any of the wicked, who now doe liue in reſt, becauſe their turne to be puniſhed muſt come, and faile not. The further it is put off from them, the heauier in the end it will fall vpon them.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond vſe is, to teach vs patience in afflictions; for as much as God will ſhortly cauſe the cup to paſſe from vs to our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. But ſay, he will not. Yet neuertheleſſe are we to poſſeſſe our ſoules in patience; reioycing and giuing thankes to God, who hath made vs worthy, not only to beleeue in him, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to ſuffer for his ſake. For we haue learned, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.22. <hi>That through many afflictions we muſt enter into the kingdome of God. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophets, and Apoſtles, and Martyrs, which were not only reuiled and ſcourged, but alſo beheaded, cut in peeces, drowned in water, conſumed in fire, by other tyrannicall deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces cruelly put to death, they all by this way receiued the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt token of their happy and bleſſed eſtate, and entred into the kingdome of God.

                  <p>The third circumſtance is, the <hi>puniſhment,</hi> a <hi>going into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity:</hi> amplified by the place.

<q>For the ſinne of a Land, God oftentimes ſendeth away the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants into captiuitie.</q>

                  <p>

                  <p>I let paſſe the multitude of Scripture-places ſeruing to this point; my Text is plaine for it. The <hi>Aramites</hi> for their <hi>three tranſgreſſions, and for foure,</hi> for their many ſinnes, for their ſinne of cruelty, for threſhing <hi>Gilead</hi> with threſhing inſtruments of Iron, were to goe into <hi>Captiuity.</hi> My doctrine ſtandeth firme;
<q>For the ſinne of a Land, God oftentimes ſendeth away the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants into captiuitie.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Into <hi>Captiuitie?</hi> Into what kinde of <hi>captiuitie?</hi> For there is a <hi>ſpirituall captiuitie,</hi> and a <hi>corporall captiuitie;</hi> a <hi>captiuitie</hi> of the minde, and a <hi>captiuitie</hi> of the body. Both are very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, but the firſt more.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, which I call the <hi>ſpirituall captiuity,</hi> and a <hi>captiuitie</hi> of the minde, is a <hi>captiuity</hi> vnder the Deuill, vnder the power of Hell, vnder, death, vnder ſin, vnder the eternall malediction
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1736:70"/> or curſe of the Law, propounded to euery one, that doth not in all points, and abſolutely, obey the Law. This <hi>Captiuity</hi> is a heauie yoake to all mankinde, conſidered without <hi>Chriſt.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one, male, and female, that hath no part in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> euery vnbeleeuing and reprobate perſon, is in this conſtruction, euen to this day a <hi>captiue.</hi> And ſuch alſo were we, by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our nature vpon our firſt Father <hi>Adams</hi> default: but now are we by the ſacrifice of the immaculate Lambe, the <hi>Lord Ieſus,</hi> ranſomed, and freed. For to this purpoſe was he ſent into the world: as it is euident, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 61.1. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18.</p>
                  <p>In both places hee profeſſeth himſelfe to bee ſent into the world for this end, euen to publiſh <hi>liberty,</hi> and <hi>freedome</hi> to <hi>cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues,</hi> and the <hi>impriſoned;</hi> which his office he hath graciouſly performed. By his <hi>Word of grace</hi> he hath ſo <hi>freed</hi> our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, formerly oppreſſed with, and <hi>captiue</hi> vnder ſin, that now there is no condemnation to vs; to vs, I ſay, who are in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and doe <hi>walke after the ſpirit,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.</p>
                  <p>This is it which our <hi>Sauiour</hi> foretold the <hi>Iewes, Iohn.</hi> 8.36. <hi>If the Sonne ſhall make you free, you ſhall be free indeed.</hi> Be it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated againe to our eternall comforts: <hi>If the Sonne ſhall make vs free, we ſhall be free indeed.</hi> But he hath made vs <hi>free:</hi> for therefore was he ſent, <hi>to publiſh libertie, and freedome to captiues;</hi> he hath paid our ranſome, <hi>his innocent, and moſt precious bloud:</hi> by it are we throughly waſhed, and cleanſed from our ſinnes. Now there is no condemnation to vs. Thus <hi>freed</hi> from our <hi>ſpirituall captiuity,</hi> bondage, and ſlauery vnder Hell, death, and ſin, let vs with boldneſſe looking vp to the throne of Grace, whereon ſitteth the Author, and Finiſher of our faith, ſay with the bleſſed Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. <hi>O Death, where is thy ſting? O Hell, where is thy victory? the ſting of death is ſinne, and the ſtrength of ſinne is the Law. But thankes be to God, who hath giuen vs victory, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Captiuity</hi> in my text, is of the other kind, <hi>a corporall cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie,</hi> a <hi>captiuitie</hi> of the body, which vſually is accompanied with two great miſeries, pointed at, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.10. The firſt, <hi>they dwell in darkneſſe and in the ſhadow of death;</hi> the ſecond, <hi>they are bound in anguiſh, and Iron.</hi> Firſt, <hi>they dwell in darkneſſe, and in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1736:70"/> the ſhadow of death,</hi> that is, they are put into deep dungeons, void of light, whereby they are as it were at deaths doore. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>they are bound in anguiſh, and iron,</hi> that is, day and night they are loaden with fetters, gyues, or ſhackles of iron; ſo loaden, that they finde no reſt vnto their bones. Thus muſt it be with them, who by ſinfull liuing prouoke the <hi>Lord</hi> to high diſpleaſure. Thus is my doctrine confirmed;
<q>For the ſin of a land, God oftentimes ſendeth away the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants into captiuity.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it true, beloued? Doth God <hi>oftentimes for the ſin of a land ſend away the inhabitants into captiuity?</hi> Let vs make this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian vſe of it: euen to powre out our ſelues in thankfulneſſe before Almighty God for his wonderfull patience towards vs. The ſins of ſuch Nations, as haue beene puniſhed with <hi>captiuity,</hi> were they more grieuous in Gods eyes, than ours are? It is not be imagined.</p>
                  <p>Our ſins are as crimſon-like, and as ſcarlet-like, as euer were theirs; the ſins of our land, crying ſins; <hi>Atheiſme, Irreligion, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, Extortion, Couetouſneſſe, Vſury, Adultery, Fornication, Vncleanneſſe, Drunkenneſſe,</hi> and many like <hi>abominations</hi> of the old man in vs, all our <hi>works of darknes,</hi> they haue made head to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and haue impudently and ſhameleſly preſſed into the preſence of Almighty God, to vrge him to powre forth the vials of his wrath and indignation vpon vs. Yet our God, <hi>good, gracious, mercifull, long ſuffering,</hi> and <hi>of great kindnes,</hi> withhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and ſtayeth his reuengefull hand, from laying vpon vs his great puniſhment of <hi>Captiuity:</hi> and ſuffereth vs to poſſeſſe our habitations in peace, and to eat the good things of the earth: O, <hi>let vs therefore confeſſe before the Lord his louing kindneſſe, and declare before the ſonnes of men the good things that he hath done for vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here (dearely beloued) let vs not preſume vpon God his <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> to lead our liues as we liſt. We cannot but ſee, that God is highly offended with vs already, though yet he be not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to execute his <hi>ſoreſt iudgements</hi> vpon vs. Gods high diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt vs, appeareth in thoſe many viſitations, by which he hath come neere vnto vs, within our memories. I
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1736:71"/> may not ſtand to amplifie, the <hi>Spaniſh ſword</hi> ſhaken ouer vs, and the <hi>great famine</hi> brought vpon vs in our late <hi>Queenes</hi> daies. Our now gracious Soueraigne hath not long ſate at the ſterne of this kingdome. But few yeares are paſſed; and yet thoſe few haue afforded manifeſt tokens of Gods ſore diſpleaſure at vs.</p>
                  <p>Haue not many thouſands of our brethren (haply not ſo grieuous ſinners as we) beene taken away by the deſtroying Angell, and yet the <hi>plague</hi> is not ceaſed? Vnleſſe we repent, and amend our liues, we may likewiſe periſh. Haue not many of our brethren (too many, if it might haue ſeemed otherwiſe to Almighty God) haue they not partly periſhed themſelues, partly loſt their cattell, and ſubſtance, in<note n="n" place="margin">An. Dom. <hi>1607</hi>
                     </note> this yeeres <hi>waters,</hi> ſuch <hi>waters,</hi> as our fore-fathers haue ſcarcely obſerued the like? If we will not <hi>waſh</hi> our ſelues from our euill doings; we ſee, God is able to <hi>waſh</hi> vs extraordinarily. The vnſeaſonable <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> giuen vs from Heauen to the <hi>rotting of our ſheepe,</hi> is but Gods warning to vs of a greater miſery to befall vs, vnleſſe we will returne from our euill waies.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore (beloued) let vs with one heart, and mind, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue for hereafter to caſt away all workes of darkneſſe, and to put on the armour of light: take we no further thought for our fleſh, to fulfill the luſts of it. Walke we from henceforth honeſtly, as in the day.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoeuer things are true, and honeſt, and iuſt, and pure, and doe pertaine to loue, and are of good report, if there bee any vertue, or praiſe, thinke we on theſe things. Thinke we on theſe things to doe them, and we ſhall not need to feare any <hi>going into captiuity;</hi> yea the <hi>deſtroying Angell</hi> ſhall haue no power ouer vs; the <hi>raging waters</hi> ſhall not hurt vs; our <hi>cattell,</hi> and whatſoeuer elſe we enioy, ſhall proſper vnder vs. For God, euen our owne God, ſhall giue vs his bleſſing.</p>

                  <p n="4">4 The deſcription of the puniſhments to be inflicted vpon them; in fiue branches. One in the ſeuenth verſe, and foure in the eighth verſe.

                  <p>This prophecy for the tenor and current of the words, is much like the former againſt the <hi>Syrians,</hi> the expoſition whereof, in ſundry ſermons heretofore deliuered, may ſerue for the expoſition of this prophecie alſo. The preface is firſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord]</hi> Not <hi>Amos,</hi> but in <hi>Amos,</hi> the <hi>Lord.</hi> The <hi>Lord, Iehouah,</hi> who made the heauens, and ſpread them out like a curtaine, to cloath himſelfe with light, as with a garment; and can againe cloath the heauens with darkneſſe, and make a ſacke their couering: the <hi>Lord, Iehouah,</hi> who made the ſea to lay the beames of his chamber therein, and placed the ſands for bounds vnto it by a perpetuall decree, neuer to be paſſed ouer, howſoeuer the waues thereof ſhall rage, and roare; and can with a word ſmite the pride thereof: at his rebuke the flouds ſhall be turned into a wilderneſſe, the ſea ſhall be dried vp; the fiſh ſhall rot for want of water, and die for thirſt: the <hi>Lord, Iehouah,</hi> who made the drie land, and ſo ſet it vpon foundations, that it ſhould neuer moue, and can couer her againe with the deepe, as with a garment; and ſo rocke her, that ſhe ſhall reele to and fro, and ſtagger like a drunken man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord]</hi> The <hi>Lord, Iehouah,</hi> whoſe throne is the heauen of heauens, and the ſea his floure to walke in, and the earth his footſtoole to tread vpon; who hath a chaire in the conſcience, and ſitteth in the heart of man, and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his moſt ſecret reines, and diuideth betwixt the fleſh and

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord]</hi> Hath he ſaid it, and ſhall he not doe it? hath he ſpoken it, and ſhall he not accompliſh it? The <hi>Lord, Iehouah,</hi> the ſtrength of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is not as man, that he ſhould lie; nor as the ſonne of man, that he ſhould repent. All his words, yea all the titles of his words are <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen.

                  <p>This point of the authority of holy Scripture I deliuered vnto you in my ſecond and ſixt Lectures vpon this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: and then noted vnto you the harmony, conſent, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of all the Prophets, Euangeliſts, and Apoſtles, from the firſt vnto the laſt; not one of them ſpake one word of a naturall man in all their miniſteries: the words which they ſpake, were the words of him that ſent them: they ſpake not of themſelues, God ſpake in them. Whenſoeuer were the time; whatſoeuer were the meanes; whoſoeuer were the man; whereſoeuer were the place; whatſoeuer were the people; the words were the <hi>Lords.</hi>

                     <hi>Azzah]</hi> It's firſt named, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.19. In the vulgar Latine, and in the Greeke, it's commonly called <hi>Gaza;</hi> it hath no other name in the new Teſtament, but <hi>Gaza.</hi> It's ſo called, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.26. And you may call it by which name you will, <hi>Azzah,</hi> or <hi>Gaza,</hi> it's not materiall.</p>
                  <p>Now by this <hi>Azzah,</hi> or <hi>Gaza,</hi> you are to vnderſtand the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the City, and not them only, but alſo the borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; all the inhabitants of the country adiacent: to all which our Prophet here denounceth Gods iudgements for their ſins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For three tranſgreſſions of Azzah, and for foure]</hi> Theſe words containing an <hi>accuſation</hi> of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> for their ſins, and the <hi>proteſtation</hi> of Almighty God againſt them for the ſame, I haue heretofore in my ſixt Lecture at large expounded, occaſioned thereto by the beginning of the third verſe: and therefore I ſhall not need at this time to make any long iteration thereof. Yet let me relate vnto you the ſumme and ſubſtance of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For three tranſgreſſions of Azzah, &amp;c.]</hi> It is as if the <hi>Lord</hi> had thus ſaid: If the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> had offended but once, or a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, I ſhould haue beene fauourable vnto them, and ſhould haue recalled them into the right way, that ſo they might be conuerted, and eſcape my puniſhments: but now, whereas they doe daily heape tranſgreſſion vpon tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and find no end of ſinning, I haue hardned my face againſt them, and will not ſuffer them to be conuerted; but indurate, and obſtinate as they are, I will vtterly deſtroy them. <hi>For three tranſgreſſions of Azzah, and for foure</hi>] The doctrine is:
<q>Many ſinnes doe plucke downe from heauen, the moſt certaine wrath and vengeance of God vpon the ſinners.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">See my ſixth Serm. on <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.</note>God is of pure eies, and beholdeth not iniquity; he hath laid righteouſneſſe to the rule, and weighed his iuſtice in a ballance.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:1736:73"/> euery ſoule that doth euill; the ſoule that ſinneth, it ſhall bee puniſhed.

                  </p>

It was the ſin of <hi>cruelty</hi> in a very high degree.</p>
                  <p>It is a <hi>cruell</hi> deed to carry away any one from his natiue Country; but him that is ſo carried away, to ſell to his mortall enemy, this is a <hi>cruelty,</hi> than which there cannot be a greater. Such was the ſin of thoſe <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> the inhabitants of <hi>Azzah.</hi> They ſold, whether the <hi>Iewes,</hi> or the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the poſterity of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and ſeruants of the <hi>liuing God,</hi> to their profeſſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies the <hi>Edomites,</hi> with this policy, that being carried farre from their owne country, they ſhould liue in <hi>eternall ſlauery</hi> and <hi>bondage,</hi> without hope euer to returne home againe.</p>
                  <p>This very crime of <hi>cruelty,</hi> is in the Prophecie of <hi>Ioel</hi> alſo, <hi>Ch.</hi> 3.6. laid to the charge of theſe <hi>Philiſtines: The children of Iudah, and the children of Ieruſalem haue ye ſold to the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that ye might ſend them far from their border:</hi> that is, Gods inheritance, his owne ſeed and ſeruants, the children of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the cruell and hard hearted Philiſtines did mancipate, and ſell away for bondſlaues to the Grecians dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling farre off, that with them they might liue in <hi>perpetuall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude</hi> and <hi>ſlauery,</hi> without all hope of <hi>liberty</hi> or <hi>redemption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in this that the Lord calleth the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> to a recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, becauſe they had ſold away <hi>his people,</hi> though they were <hi>their captiues,</hi> vnto <hi>Infidels,</hi> we may learne this leſſon;
<q>It is not lawfull to commit the children of beleeuers into the hands of Infidels.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vnlawfulnes herof appeareth by the charge which <hi>Moſes</hi> giueth the <hi>Iſraelites, Deut.</hi> 7.3. His charge is concerning the <hi>Hittites,</hi> the <hi>Gergaſites,</hi> the <hi>Amorites,</hi> the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> the <hi>Periz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zites,</hi>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:1736:75"/> the <hi>Hiuits,</hi> and the <hi>Iebuſites,</hi> that they ſhould not at all make any couenant with them, nor giue them their children in <hi>mariage.</hi> And why ſo? Becauſe by ſuch <hi>couenants</hi> &amp; <hi>mariages</hi> they might be withdrawn from the true ſeruice of God, to the prophane worſhip of Idols. For ſo it's ſaid, verſe the 4. <hi>They will cauſe thy ſon to turne away from me, and to ſerue other gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The danger of ſuch <hi>couenants</hi> and <hi>mariages, S.

                  <p>In like caſe it is with men. They that fall into familiarity with the wicked, doe couple themſelues with them, and ſo are led out of the way, and made to worke wickedneſſe before the <hi>Lord.</hi> From this <gap reason="foreign">

Tenebras vocat infideles,</hi> ſaith <hi>Muſculus</hi> vpon the Text; <hi>S. Paul</hi> calleth <hi>vnbeleeuers, darkneſſe,</hi> for their ignorance of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1736:75"/> God, and the blindneſſe of their hearts: but he calleth the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, light,</hi> for their knowledge of God, by which their hearts are through the holy Ghoſt <hi>illuminated. Light</hi> hath no <hi>communion</hi> with <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> therefore <hi>beleeuers</hi> are not to <hi>haue familiarity</hi> with <hi>vnbeleeuers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third, <hi>what concord hath</hi> Chriſt <hi>with</hi> Belial? The anſwer is negatiue: <hi>none.</hi> The oppoſition betweene theſe two, <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Belial,</hi> is moſt hoſtile. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Author of our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Belial</hi> of our perdition: <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the reſtorer of all things; <hi>Belial</hi> the deſtroier: <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Prince of <hi>light; Belial</hi> the prince of <hi>darkneſſe.</hi> In ſuch hoſtile oppoſition there can be no concord: no concord between the <hi>Author of our ſaluation,</hi> and the <hi>author of our perdition;</hi> no concord between the <hi>reſtorer of all things,</hi> and the <hi>deſtroyer of all things;</hi> no concord betweene the <hi>Prince of light,</hi> &amp; the <hi>prince of darknes:</hi> therefore they that <hi>beleeue</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are not to <hi>haue familiarity</hi> with <hi>vnbeleeuers.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>To ground a ſecond doctrine hereon; we are to note, that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1736:77"/> the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> ſold away the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to the <hi>Idumaeans,</hi> at ſuch time as they were <hi>their captiues:</hi> and ſo did adde affliction to the afflicted. The doctrine is,
<q>It is a very grieuous thing to adde affliction to the afflicted.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Witneſſe the complaint made by the <hi>captiue Iewes</hi> againſt the inſolency of the <hi>Chaldeans, Pſal.</hi> 137.3. <hi>They that led vs away captiue required of vs ſongs, and mirth in our heauineſſe, ſaying, Sing vs one of the ſongs of</hi> Sion. <hi>They</hi>] the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> in whoſe country wee were priſoners, <hi>required of vs</hi>] ſcornfully, and diſdainfully, thereby to adde to our griefes: <hi>they required of vs ſongs</hi>] ſuch <hi>ſongs,</hi> as we were wont to ſing in <hi>Sion, Ieruſalem,</hi> and our <hi>owne country</hi> before the deſtruction of the Temple, and our captiuity. <hi>They required of vs,</hi> not <hi>ſongs</hi> only, <hi>but mirth alſo</hi>] they ſcoffingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired vs to be merry, when they ſaw vs ſo heauy hearted, as nothing could make vs glad. <hi>They required of vs ſongs and mirth in our heauineſſe, ſaying, Sing vs one of the ſongs of</hi> Sion] <hi>ſing</hi> for vs, or in our hearing, ſome one or other of thoſe Songs which you were wont to <hi>ſing</hi> in <hi>Sion,</hi> when you were at home in your owne country.</p>
                  <p>Intolerable is the hard heartedneſſe, cruelty, and ſcoffing nature of the wicked, when they haue gotten Gods children into their nets. God cannot away with ſuch vnmercifulneſſe, and want of pity. He reproueth it in the <hi>Babylonians, Eſa.</hi> 47.6. where thus ſaith the <hi>Lord, I was wroth with my people, I haue polluted mine inheritance, and giuen them into thine hand: thou didſt ſhew them no mercy; but thou didſt lay thy very heauy yoke vpon the ancient:</hi> therefore now heare, deſtruction ſhall come vpon thee. <hi>Magna abominatio eoram Deo eſt, afflicto ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere afflictionem; clamat<expan>

Yea, we are aſſured by <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.19. that the Lord <hi>looketh downe from the height of his ſanctuary, and out of heauen beholdeth the earth,</hi> that he may <hi>heare,</hi> and ſo take pity of the ſighings, groanings, and lamentable cries of ſuch his people as are in affliction.</p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:1736:77"/>
                  <p>The time will not ſuffer me now to trouble you with more Texts of <hi>Scripture;</hi> let the now alleaged be ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme my propounded doctrine, that <hi>it is a grieuous thing to adde affliction to the afflicted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vſes of this doctrine, I can but point at. One is, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the <hi>Nimrods,</hi> and tyrants of this world, which haue no <hi>pity,</hi> no <hi>compaſſion</hi> vpon the <hi>poore</hi> and <hi>diſtreſſed.</hi> Such in the end ſhall know by their owne lamentable experience, that to be true which <hi>Salomon</hi> hath vttered, <hi>Prou.</hi> 21.13. <hi>Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the crying of the poore, ſhall cry himſelfe and not be heard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſecond vſe is to ſtirre vs vp to the performance of this our Chriſtian duty, euen to take pity vpon all that are in any kind of miſery: if our neighbours be deſtitute of aid and help, we may not like wilde beaſts, lift vp our ſelues againſt them, and ſo tread them vnder foot. No. How dare we moleſt and trouble them, whom by Gods appointment we are to releeue and ſuccour? We are commanded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.11. to <hi>open our hands to the needy and poore that are in our land:</hi> to open our hands to them for their helpe and ſuccour.</p>
                  <p>It is not enough for vs to <hi>abſtaine</hi> from all <hi>iniury</hi> and <hi>harme-doing,</hi> but withall muſt we endeuour to <hi>releeue the oppreſſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſeruice of ours will be acceptable vnto God? God for it will giue vs his bleſſing: God will bleſſe vs for the time of our being here; and when the <hi>day of our diſſolution</hi> ſhall be, that we muſt leaue this <hi>earthly tabernacle,</hi> then will the Son of man, ſitting vpon the throne of his glory, welcome vs with a <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite benedicti; Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit ye the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome prepared for you from the foundations of the world. For I was an hungred, and ye gaue me meat; I thirſted, and ye gaue me drinke; I was a ſtranger, and ye lodged me; I was naked, and ye cloathed me; I was ſicke, and ye viſited me; I was in priſon, and ye came vnto me;</hi> in as much as you haue done theſe things to the needy and diſtreſſed, ye haue done them vnto me. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdome prepared for you from the foundations of the world.</hi>

The ſame <hi>puniſhment,</hi> which is there threatned to the <hi>Syrians,</hi> vnder the names of <hi>Hazael,</hi> and <hi>Benhadad,</hi> is in this ſeuenth verſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> vnder the name of <hi>Azzah.</hi> And therefore, as there I did, ſo muſt I here commend vnto you three circumſtances:
<list>
                        <item>1 The <hi>puniſher:</hi> the <hi>Lord, I.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2 The <hi>puniſhment:</hi> by fire, <hi>I will ſend a fire.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3 The <hi>puniſhed:</hi> the <hi>Azzites,</hi> the inhabitants of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: the <hi>Philiſtines vpon the walls and palaces of</hi> Azzah.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>puniſher</hi> is the <hi>Lord,</hi> for thus ſaith the <hi>Lord, I will ſend.</hi> The note yeeldeth vs this doctrine:
<q>
                        <pb n="145" facs="tcp:1736:78"/>It is proper to the Lord to execute vengeance vpon the wicked for their ſinnes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This doctrine I proued at large in my eighth Lecture vpon this prophecie. Yet for their ſakes, who then heard me not, or haue forgotten what then they heard, I will by a few texts of Scripture againe confirme it vnto you: <hi>It is proper to the Lord to execute vengeance vpon the wicked for their ſinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This office of <hi>executing vengeance vpon the wicked for their ſinnes,</hi> God arrogateth and aſſumeth to himſelfe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.35. where he ſaith, <hi>Vengeance and recompence are mine.</hi> This due is aſcribed vnto the <hi>Lord</hi> by <hi>S. Paul, Rom.</hi> 12.19. <hi>It is written, vengeance is mine, I will repay ſaith the Lord.</hi> By the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> chap. 10.30. <hi>Vengeance belongeth vnto me, I will ecompence, ſaith the Lord.</hi> By the ſweet Singer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.1. <hi>O Lord God the auenger, O God the auenger.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Nahum</hi> trebleth the phraſe, Chap. 1.2. <hi>The Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengeth, the Lord reuengeth, the Lord will take vengeance on his aduerſaries.</hi> Theſe few texts of holy Writ doe firmely proue my doctrine: <hi>It is proper to the Lord to execute vengeance vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wicked for their ſinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One vſe of this doctrine is, to teach vs heedfulneſſe in all our wayes; that we doe not worke wickedneſſe before the <hi>Lord,</hi> and ſo prouoke him to <hi>execute his vengeance</hi> on vs. Beloued, let vs not forget it: though God be good, gracious, mercifull, and long-ſuffering, yet is he alſo a iuſt God, <hi>God the auenger,</hi> and <hi>puniſher.</hi> It is <hi>proper vnto him to execute vengeance vpon the wicked for their ſinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſecond vſe is, to admoniſh vs not to intermeddle in the Lords office. It is his office <hi>to execute vengeance;</hi> we therefore may not doe it. If a brother, or neighbour, or ſtranger doe wrong vs, it is our part <hi>to forgiue him,</hi> and leaue <hi>reuengement</hi> to God, to whom it appertaineth. To this Chriſtian and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table courſe, our Sauiour worketh vs by a ſtrong argument, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.15. <hi>If ye doe not forgiue men their trespaſſes, no more will your Father forgiue you your trespaſſes.</hi> Forgiue, and you ſhall be forgiuen; forgiue not, and yee ſhall neuer be forgiuen.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore (dearely beloued) ſuffer your ſelues to be exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:1736:79"/> as the <hi>Romans</hi> were by <hi>S. Paul, chap.</hi> 12.19. <hi>Dearely beloued, if it be poſſible, as much as in you is, haue peace with all men; recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to no man euill for euill: auenge not your ſelues, but giue place vnto wrath, for it is written: vengeance is mine, I will repay, ſaith the Lord.</hi> It is <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oper to the Lord to execute vengeance vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wicked for their ſinnes.</hi> Here we ſee, that for the ſinnes of the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> God reſolueth to ſend a <hi>fire</hi> to <hi>deuoure their wals and palaces.</hi> This was my ſecond circumſtance; the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the puniſhment; <hi>I will ſend a fire.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>Many deſolations hath God wrought by <hi>fire.</hi> By <hi>fire</hi> he laid waſte <hi>Sodom, Gomorrah,</hi> and their <hi>ſiſter cities, Gen.</hi> 19.24. By <hi>fire</hi> he did eat vp <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu, Leuit.</hi> 10.2. By <hi>fire</hi> he cut off the two hundred and fifty men, that were in the rebellion of <hi>Korah, Numb.</hi> 16.35. By <hi>fire</hi> he deuoured two Captaines, and twice fifty men, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1.10. and 12. Why doe I load your memories with multitude of examples for this point? My text telleth you that <hi>fire,</hi> Gods creature, becommeth Gods inſtrument, and executioner of his vengeance for the ſinnes of <hi>Azzah,</hi> to <hi>conſume her walls and deuoure her palaces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will ſend a fire]</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">See Lect. 8.</note> By <hi>fire</hi> in this place, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. the learned Expoſitors doe vnderſtand, not only <hi>naturall fire,</hi> but alſo the <hi>ſword,</hi> and <hi>peſtil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So large is the ſignification of <hi>fire</hi> in the metaphoricall vnderſtanding. The doctrine is,
<q>The fire, (<hi>whether</hi> Naturall, <hi>or</hi> Metaphoricall) <hi>that is,</hi> The fire, and all other creatures, are at the Lords commandement, to be employed by him in the puniſhment of the wicked.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>A truth heretofore proued vnto you, as out of other places of holy Writ, ſo out of the ſtory of Gods viſitation vpon <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptians, Exod.</hi> 8, 9, and 10. Chapters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you know, that <hi>Frogs, Lice, Flies, Graſhoppers, Thunder, Haile, Lightning, Murraine, Botches</hi> and <hi>Sores,</hi> did inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally <hi>auenge</hi> God vpon man and beaſts in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> I ſtand not now to enlarge this proofe.</p>
                  <p>The vſe of this doctrine is, to teach vs how to behaue our
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1736:79"/> ſelues at ſuch times as God <hi>ſhall viſit vs with his rod of correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> how to carry our ſelues in all our <hi>afflictions.</hi> We muſt not ſo much looke to the <hi>inſtruments,</hi> as to the <hi>Lord</hi> that ſmiteth by them. If the <hi>fire,</hi> or <hi>water,</hi> or any other of Gods <hi>creatures,</hi> ſhall at any time rage and preuaile againſt vs, we muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that it is God that ſendeth them, to worke his holy will vpon vs. Here he <hi>ſent a fire vpon</hi> Azzah, <hi>to conſume her walls, and deuoure her palaces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here you haue my third circumſtance, the circumſtance of the <hi>puniſhed,</hi> in theſe words; <hi>the walls of</hi> Azzah, <hi>and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces thereof] Azzah,</hi> one of the fiue Prouinces, or Dutchies of <hi>Palaeſtina,</hi> and a Citie of the ſame name, as I ſhewed you in my laſt Lecture. The walls and palaces here mentioned, doe ſignifie thus much; that the Citie <hi>Azzah</hi> was well fortified, and beautified with ſumptuous buildings; Yet muſt <hi>Azzah,</hi> notwithſtanding the <hi>beauty of her buildings,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength of her ſtrong holds,</hi> be <hi>deuoured with fire: I will ſend a fire vpon the wall of</hi> Azzah, <hi>and it ſhall deuoure the palaces thereof.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>The great Citie <hi>Azzah,</hi> for all her ſtrong walls, muſt ſhee be ſpoiled? The doctrine to be learned from hence, is:
<q>No munition can ſaue that city, which God well haue deſtroyed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon is; becauſe there is no <hi>ſtrength</hi> but of <hi>God,</hi> and from <hi>God.</hi> For what are all the <hi>munitions</hi> in the world to the <hi>great God of Heauen and Earth?</hi>

Thus much of my firſt doctrine grounded vpon the third circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this ſeuenth verſe, the circumſtance of the puniſhed, <hi>No munition can ſaue that citie which God will haue deſtroyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, this ouerthrow of the walls of <hi>Azzah</hi> in Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, teacheth vs thus much,
<q>It is the good bleſſing of God vpon a kingdome, to haue walls, ſtrong holds, <hi>munitions, fortreſſes and bulwarkes,</hi> for a defe ſe againſt enemies.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:1736:80"/>
                  <p>The reaſon is, becauſe theſe be the meanes which God vſually bleſſeth, to procure outward ſafety.</p>
                  <p>The vſe is to teach vs carefully to prepare ſuch againſt time of trouble: yet with this caution, that we reſt not in them, but depend wholly vpon <hi>Gods</hi> bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>And here we are to powre out our ſoules in thankfulneſſe before Almightie God, for bleſſing this our Countrey with the ſtrength of <hi>walls;</hi> of <hi>walls</hi> by ſea, and <hi>walls</hi> by land; by ſea with <hi>ſhips,</hi> and at land with <hi>ſtrong holds,</hi> caſtles and fortreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; by ſea and land, with men of wiſdome and valour, to bid battell to the proudeſt enemie that dare aduance himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs. Confeſſe we with <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 18.2. The <hi>Lord is our rocke, our fortreſſe, hee that deliuereth vs, our God, our ſtrength, our ſhield, the horne of our ſaluation, and our refuge.</hi> In him we truſt, and<note n="d" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.11.</note> feare not what <hi>man</hi> can doe vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>Yet further. The <hi>fire</hi> in Gods anger deuouring the palaces of <hi>Azzah,</hi> teacheth vs, that
<q>God depriueth vs of a great bleſſing, when hee taketh from vs our dwelling houſes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This doctrine I commended to you in my <hi>Eight Lecture</hi> vpon this prophecie. The truth is experimentally made good vnto vs by that great commodity or contentment, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to euery one of vs by our dwelling houſes.</p>
                  <p>The vſe of this doctrine is three-fold. It teacheth vs, 1. To be humbled before Almighty God, whenſoeuer <hi>our dwelling-houſes</hi> are taken from vs: 2. Since wee peaceably enioy <hi>our dwelling-houſes,</hi> to vſe them for the furtherance of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: 3. To praiſe God continually for the comfortable vſe we haue of <hi>our dwelling-houſes.</hi> Thus farre of the ſeuenth verſe. The eighth followeth.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I will cut off the inhabitant of</hi> Aſhdod] Of the like iudgement in the ſame words you haue heard before in verſ. 5. threatned to the <hi>Syrians, I will cut off the inhabitant of</hi> Bikeath-Auen, <hi>and him that holdeth the Scepter out of</hi> Beth-eden. The words I then expounded at large: the briefe or ſumme whereof, is:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I]</hi> the <hi>Lord, Iehouah, will cut off</hi>] will vtterly deſtroy, and root out <hi>the inhabitant</hi>] not one alone, but all, and euery one of the inhabitants, <hi>of Aſhdod</hi>] one of the fiue chiefe Cities of the <hi>Philiſtines: And I will</hi> vtterly deſtroy, or root out, <hi>him that holdeth the Scepter</hi>] the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> their chiefe Ruler; their King, making his reſidence at <hi>Aſhkelon</hi>] another of the fiue Cities of <hi>Palaeſtina. I will cut off the inhabitant of</hi> Aſhdod, <hi>and him that holdeth the Scepter from</hi> Aſhkelon.]</p>
                  <p>In the words I obſerue, as before, three circumſtances.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 The puniſher, the <hi>Lord; I.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2 The puniſhment, a cutting off; <hi>I will cut off.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3 The puniſhed, the inhabitants of <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> and the Scepter-bearer of <hi>Aſhkelon.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>By the firſt circumſtance, (the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelfe taking venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance into his owne hands,) you may be remembred of a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine often commended to you in this and other Lectures;
<q>It is proper to the Lord to execute vengeance vpon the wicked for their ſinnes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>From all three circumſtances, of the <hi>puniſher,</hi> the <hi>puniſhment,</hi> and the <hi>puniſhed</hi> ioyntly conſidered, we may take a profitable leſſon. We ſee that the <hi>cutting off of the inhabitants of</hi> Aſhdod, <hi>and of him that holdeth the Scepter from</hi> Aſhkelon, is the <hi>Lords</hi> proper worke. The leſſon which we learne from hence is,
<q>No calamity or miſery befalleth any one, or whatſoeuer eſtate or degree, by chance, or at aduenture.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This doctrine I handled at large in my <hi>tenth Lecture.</hi> The truth of it dependeth vpon this propoſition;
<q>The whole world, with all things therein, is wholly and alone ſubiect to the ſoueraigntie, dominion and rule of Almightie God; by whoſe prouidence all things are preſerued, all things are ruled, and things are ordered.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe were the three degrees, by which I told you, you might
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1736:81"/> diſcerne and take notice of the act of diuine prouidence. The firſt was <hi>gradus conſeruationis;</hi> the ſecond <hi>gradus gubernatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis;</hi> the third was <hi>gradus ordinationis;</hi> the firſt degree was the degree of <hi>maintenance</hi> or <hi>preſeruation;</hi> the ſecond degree was the degree of <hi>rule</hi> or <hi>gouernment;</hi> the third degree was the degree of <hi>ordination</hi> or <hi>direction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt implieth thus much, that
<q>All things in generall, and euery thing in particular, are by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God ſuſtained ordinarily in the ſame ſtate of nature and naturall proprieties, wherein they were created.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond thus much, that
<q>Almightie God for his vnlimited power gouerneth all things in the world, and ruleth them, <hi>pro libertate voluntatis ſuae,</hi> euen as he liſteth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third thus much, that
<q>God of his admirable wiſdome ordaineth, and ſetteth in order, whatſoeuer things in the world ſeeme to be moſt out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: he bringeth all to his chiefly intended end; all doe make for his glory.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this diuine ordination, three things doe concurre: <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutio finis, mediorum ad finem dispoſitio,</hi> and <hi>dispoſitorum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectio.</hi> Firſt, God <hi>appointeth an end</hi> to euery thing. Secondly, he <hi>dispoſeth the meanes</hi> vnto the end. Thirdly, he <hi>directeth the meanes</hi> ſo diſpoſed. From theſe points thus ſummarily rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I inferre my propounded doctrine:
<q>No calamity or miſery befalleth any one, of whatſoeuer eſtate or degree, by chance, or at aduenture.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For if it be true (as true it is, and the gates of Hell ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be able to preuaile againſt it,) that God by his wonderfull prouidence <hi>maintaineth,</hi> and <hi>preſerueth; ruleth,</hi> and <hi>gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; ordereth, dispoſeth,</hi> and <hi>directeth</hi> all things in this world, euen to the very haires of our heads; it cannot be, that <hi>any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie</hi> or <hi>miſery</hi> ſhould befall any one of vs by <hi>aduenture,</hi> by <hi>hap-hazzard,</hi> by <hi>chance,</hi> by <hi>fortune.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Epicure</hi> in <hi>Iob, Chap.</hi> 22.13. was in a groſſe and ſoule errour, to thinke that God walking in the circle of heauen, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not thorow the darke clouds ſee our miſdoings, and iudge vs
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1736:82"/> for them. Farre be it from vs, (beloued) ſo to be conceited. We may not thinke our <hi>God,</hi> to be a <hi>God</hi> to halfes, and in part only; a <hi>God</hi> aboue, and not beneath the Moone; a <hi>God</hi> vpon the Mountaines, and not in the Valleyes; a <hi>God</hi> in the greater, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> in the leſſer employments. We may not thus thinke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued. We haue learned better things out of <hi>Amos</hi> 9. <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. that God is euery where preſent, and that there is no euaſion from him. No corner in <hi>Hell,</hi> no manſion in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,</hi> no caue in <hi>the top of Carmel,</hi> no fiſhes belly in <hi>the bottome of the ſea,</hi> no darke dungeon in <hi>the land of captiuity,</hi> no place of any ſecrecie any where, is able to hide vs from the <hi>preſence of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The leaſt moments and tittles in the world, that you can imagine, God his care and prouidence reacheth vnto: to a <hi>handfull of meale;</hi> to <hi>a cruſe of oile</hi> in a poore widowes houſe; to the <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon is, becauſe there is no place to flie vnto from his preſence: None. No corner in <hi>Hell,</hi> no manſion in <hi>Heauen,</hi> no

You haue the reaſon of my Doctrine: the vſes follow.</p>
                  <p>Is it true? Is there <hi>no ſafe being in City, or Country, from the hand of God, when he is diſpoſed to puniſh?</hi> One vſe hereof is, to teach vs to take patiently whatſoeuer <hi>afflictions</hi> ſhall befall vs. <hi>Afflictions</hi> I call, whatſoeuer is any way oppoſite to humane nature; ſuch as are the temptations of the fleſh, the world, and the Deuill: the diſeaſes of the body, an infortunate husband, or wife, rebellious children, vnthankfull friends, loſſe of goods, reproaches, ſlanders, warre, peſtilence, famine, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, death, euery croſſe and paſſion, bodily, or ghoſtly, proper to our ſelues, or appertaining to ſuch as are of our bloud, priuate or publike, ſecret or manifeſt, either by our owne deſerts gotten, or otherwiſe impoſed vpon vs.</p>
                  <p>All, and euery of theſe, <hi>true Chriſtians</hi> will patiently vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe. For they with their ſharp-ſighted eie of faith, doe clearely ſee the <hi>Hand</hi> of God in euery of their <hi>moleſtations:</hi> and in great contentment they take vp the words of patient <hi>Iob, Chap.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Shall wee receiue good at the hand of God, and not receiue euill?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here let euery <hi>afflicted</hi> ſoule examine it ſelfe, how it is affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the <hi>affliction</hi> vnder which it groaneth. If you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of your <hi>afflictions,</hi> as of God his fatherly <hi>chaſtiſements,</hi> and ſo endure them, bleſſed are ye. Of this bleſſedneſſe Saint <hi>Iames, Chap.</hi> 1.12. doth aſſure you: <hi>Bleſſed is the man that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth tentation: for when he is tried he ſhall receiue the crowne of life, which the Lord hath promiſed to them that loue him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, is it true? Is <hi>there no ſafe being in City or Country, from the hand of God, when he is diſpoſed to puniſh?</hi> A ſecond vſe of this doctrine is, to admoniſh vs, that we labour aboue all things to obtaine Gods fauour, and to abide in it: ſo ſhall we be ſafe from the feare of euill.</p>
                  <p>Now for the obtaining of Gods fauour, we muſt doe foure

                  <p>The time will not ſuffer me to enlarge theſe points. Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, faith in Chriſt, repentance, and a new life; theſe foure will be vnto you, as <hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder was vnto the Angels. Of that ladder you may reade, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.12. that it <hi>ſtood vpon the earth; the top of it did reach to heauen,</hi> and the <hi>Angells of God went vp it.</hi> So may you by theſe foure, <hi>Humiliation, Faith, Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Newneſſe of life,</hi> as it were by ſo many ſteps, and rounds of a ladder, climbe vp to heauen.</p>
                  <p>Here you haue no continuing Citie; you are but ſtrangers, and pilgrims on the earth; your countrey is aboue, the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> there let your hearts be. As for the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vexations, tribulation, miſeries and croſſes, wherewith this mortall life of yours is ſeaſoned, let them be your ioy.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, is it true? Is there <hi>no ſafe being in citie or countrie from the hand of God, when he is dispoſed to puniſh?</hi> A third vſe of this doctrine is, for the terrour of ſuch as lie wallowing in the filthineſſe of their ſins. Many there are, wicked wretches, who, if God ſhall for a time deferre the puniſhments due vnto their ſinnes, are ready to thinke that God takes no notice of their ſinnes. Theſe ſay in their heart there is no God.</p>

                  <p>Strange are the effects wrought in the wicked by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and long ſuffering of God; thereby they grow worſe and worſe, obdurate, and hardned in their ſinnes. Yet let them be aduiſed: for they day will come, and it comes apace, wherein

                  <p>The <hi>Philiſtines</hi> had their beginning from <hi>Caſluchim,</hi> a grand-childe of <hi>Chane,</hi> the accurſed iſſue of <hi>Noah,</hi> as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.14.

                  <q>Many ſinnes doe plucke downe from heauen the moſt certaine wrath and vengeance of God vpon the ſinners.</q>
                  <p>God is pure of eies, and beholdeth not iniquity: Hee hath laid righteouſneſſe to the rule, and weighed his iuſtice in a ballance. The ſentence is paſſed forth, and muſt ſtand vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolable, euen as long as Sun and Moone: Tribulation and anguiſh vpon euery ſoule that doth euill. The ſoule that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it ſhall bee puniſhed. God makes it good by an oath, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.41. That he will whet his glittering ſword, and his hand ſhall take hold on iugdement to execute vengeance for ſin. His ſoule hateth and abhorreth ſinne; his law curſeth and condemneth ſinne; his hand ſmiteth and ſcourgeth ſin. Sinne was his motiue to caſt downe Angels into Hell; to thruſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> out of Paradiſe; to turne Cities into aſhes; to ruinate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; to torment his owne bowels in the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh. Becauſe of ſinne he drowned the old world, and becauſe of ſinne ere long will burne this. Thus doe <hi>many ſinne plucke downe from Heauen the moſt certaine wrath and vengeance of God vpon the ſinners.</hi>

                  <p>One vſe of this doctrine was; to teach vs heedfulneſſe in all our waies, that wee doe not by our many ſinnes prouoke Almighty God to high diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond vſe was; to moue vs to a ſerious contemplation of the wonderfull patience of Almighty God, who did ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly forbeare theſe <hi>Tyrians,</hi> till by <hi>three</hi> and <hi>foure tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> by their many ſinnes they had prouoked him to indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1736:91"/> of theſe words I haue formerly deliuered vnto you in my <hi>twelfth Lecture,</hi> and my meditations vpon the 6. <hi>verſe.</hi> There the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> are condemned for <hi>carrying away priſoners the whole captiuity, to ſhut them vp in</hi> Edom: and here are the <hi>Tyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> condemned for <hi>ſhutting the whole captiuity in</hi> Edom. The ſin ſeemeth to be the ſame in both; the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi> Both did <hi>ſhut vp the whole captiuity in</hi> Edom; that is, as <hi>Ioel chap.</hi> 3.6. ſpeaketh; they both did ſell away <hi>the children of Iudah, and the children of Ieruſalem vnto the Grecians, that they might ſend them farre from their borders.</hi> God his peculiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, his owne ſeed, and ſeruants, the <hi>children of Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> were by the cruell and hard-hearted <hi>Philiſtines</hi> and <hi>Tyrians,</hi> mancipated, and ſold away forbond ſlaues to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> dwelling farre off, that with them they might liue in perpetuall ſeruitude and ſlauery, without all hope of liberty or redemption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> noteth a difference betwixt that ſinne of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and this of the <hi>Tyrians.</hi> The Philiſtines <hi>carried away priſoners the whole captiuity, to ſhut them vp in</hi> Edom. They did, as they thought, but what they might doe lawfully, by the law of nations. The <hi>Iewes</hi> were their <hi>captiues</hi> and <hi>priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> conquered by a ſtrong hand in <hi>open hoſtility,</hi> and for this reſpect they <hi>ſhut them vp in</hi> Edom; they ſold them to the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> to be by them tranſported to the <hi>Idumaeans.</hi> But theſe <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> had no ſuch pretence of excuſe. They did not with a ſtrong hand, in <hi>open hoſtility</hi> conquer the <hi>Iews,</hi> &amp; ſo <hi>take them priſoners,</hi> but did <hi>ſurpriſe</hi> them by <hi>deceit,</hi> and <hi>trecherie,</hi> as they lay at <hi>Tyrus</hi> for <hi>trafficke</hi> and <hi>entercourſe of merchandiſe;</hi> and thus ſurpriſed they <hi>ſhut them vp in</hi> Edom; they ſold them to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> to be by them tranſported to the <hi>Idumaeans,</hi> farre from their owne country, euen to <hi>Italy.</hi> For it is a conſtant tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in all <hi>Hebrew</hi> hiſtories, that a great part of the <hi>Italian</hi> nation, ſpecially thoſe that dwelt at <hi>Rome,</hi> had their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the <hi>Idumaeans.</hi> But I wil not proſecute this opinion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They ſhut the whole captiuity in</hi> Edom] They ſpared not, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>women,</hi> or <hi>children,</hi> or the <hi>aged;</hi> they tooke no pity, no compaſſion, vpon either <hi>ſex,</hi> or <hi>age;</hi> but <hi>all</hi> of <hi>all</hi> ſorts, <hi>male</hi>

                  <p>Now behold the foulneſſe of this ſinne wherewith the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> are here charged. It was the ſin of <hi>cruelty</hi> in a very high degree. It is a <hi>cruell deed</hi> to detaine any one vnlawfully from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into his natiue country: but him that is ſo detained, to ſell away for a <hi>bondſlaue</hi> to his <hi>mortalleſt enemie,</hi> this a <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,</hi> than which there cannot be a greater. Such was the ſin of theſe <hi>Tyrians; They ſold the Iewes, Iacobs poſterity,</hi> and God his ſeruants, to their <hi>profeſſed enemies,</hi> the <hi>Edomites,</hi> with this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, that being carried farre from their owne country, they might liue in eternall <hi>ſlauery</hi> and <hi>bondage,</hi> without hope euer to returne home againe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They ſhut the whole captiuity in</hi> Edom] The <hi>Tyrians</hi> are here diſproued, for deliuering vp <hi>Gods inheritance,</hi> a beleeuing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, into the hands of profane <hi>Edomites.</hi> And it may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you of a leſſon heretofore commended to your Chriſtian conſiderations;
<q>It is not lawfull to commit the children of beleeuers into the hands of infidels.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon is, that they be not withdrawne from their holy <hi>faith,</hi> religious <hi>worſhip,</hi> and <hi>ſeruice</hi> of God.</p>

                  <q>They haue not remembred the couenant of brethren</q>

And God in his holy word commandeth you to <hi>be ſubiect to the higher powers,</hi> as you haue already heard, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>to honour the King,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.17. <hi>to ſubmit your ſelues to all manner ordinance of man for his ſake, whether it be vnto the King as vnto the ſuperiour, or vnto other gouernours, verſ.</hi> 13. you haue taken your <hi>oath of allegiance,</hi> and ſworne obedience to your King; breake not your <hi>couenant</hi> with him, that Gods wrath breake not forth in fire againſt you, as it did againſt theſe <hi>Tyrians,</hi> for not <hi>remembring the couenant of brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus farre by occaſion of the firſt expoſition of theſe words, <hi>They remembred not the couenant of brethren,</hi> that is, they <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred not the couenant</hi> made betweene their King, King <hi>Hiram,</hi> and the King of <hi>Jſrael,</hi> King <hi>Solomon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſomewhat of the other expoſition. <hi>They remembred not the couenant of brethren;</hi> that is, <hi>they remembred not the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant</hi> made by nature betweene the <hi>Iewes, Iſraelites,</hi> and <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> brethren lineally deſcended from two naturall brethren, <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau.</hi> They knew full well, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> were the iſſue of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and the <hi>Edomites</hi> of <hi>Eſau;</hi> they knew likewiſe, that the <hi>Edomites</hi> bore a mortall hatred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> yet fold they the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> vnto the <hi>Edomites;</hi> and are therefore here ſaid <hi>not to remember the brotherly couenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The man that conſpireth miſchiefe and deſtruction to his <hi>brother,</hi> is a monſter in nature, worthy to be purſued with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall deteſtation: and whoſoeuer abhorreth not from conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to ſuch a wickedneſſe, but giueth furtherance, or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1736:94"/> thereto, he is holden in the ſame impiety. The <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> ſought the deſtruction of the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and the <hi>Tyrians</hi> did further them in their bloudy deſignes; the <hi>Tyrians</hi> therefore are partakers with the <hi>Edomites</hi> in the ſinne of <hi>vnmercifulneſſe.</hi> Which ſin is here laid vnto their charge in theſe words, <hi>They remembred not the brotherly couenant.</hi> Hence we may take this leſſon;
<q>It is a thing very diſtaſtfull and vnpleaſing vnto God, either for brethren to be at variance among themſelues, or for others to countenance them in their quarrels.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our aſſent to this truth, the light of nature within vs doth extort from vs. Of the firſt part of my propoſition, wherein I auow it to <hi>be a very diſtaſtfull thing vnto God for brethren to bee at variance among themſelues,</hi> I ſhall haue fit opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to entreat, when I ſhall come to the eleuenth verſe of this Chapter, where <hi>Edom</hi> is reproued for <hi>purſuing his brother with the ſword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the other part, wherein I do affirme it to <hi>be an vnpleaſing thing to God for any to countenance brethren in their quarrels,</hi> I will by Gods aſſiſtance ſpeake at this time very briefly.</p>
                  <q>It is a thing very diſtaſtfull and vnpleaſing vnto God, for any to countenance brethren in their quarrels.</q>
                  <p>The aduice is good which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giueth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Haue ye no fellowſhip with the vnfruitfull workes of darkneſſe, but euen reproue them rather.</hi> What are the <hi>workes of darkneſſe,</hi> but <hi>the workes of the fleſh?</hi> Now in <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.20. in the Catalogue of the <hi>workes of the fleſh,</hi> we finde <hi>hatred, debate, wrath, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</hi> With theſe therefore we muſt haue no <hi>fellowſhip,</hi> we muſt <hi>reproue</hi> them rather.</p>
                  <p>Muſt we haue no fellowſhip with them? Muſt we <hi>reproue</hi> them rather? What ſaith old <hi>Adam?</hi> What ſaith <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>bloud</hi> to this? Our <hi>Gallants</hi> of this age can entertaine no ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice: that it may be fulfilled which our Sauiour <hi>Chriſt</hi> foretold of the end of the world, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.10. and 16. <hi>Nation ſhall riſe againſt nation, kingdome againſt kingdome, a father againſt his ſon, a brother againſt his brother, a kinſman againſt his kinſman, and a friend againſt his friend.</hi>

                  <p>A fitter remedy for this malady I finde none, than to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate bleſſed <hi>Abraham.</hi> There grew a debate betweene his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and the ſeruants of <hi>Lot;</hi> their heardmen could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. What doth <hi>Abraham</hi> in this caſe? As the manner of <hi>Maſters</hi> is now adaies? No, he breaketh not out into <hi>choler;</hi> he ſaith not, <hi>My ſeruants are abuſed; my coſin</hi> Lot <hi>his ſeruants doe ſeeke to crow ouer them, and to rule the roſt as they liſt. This is an iniury to mee their Maſter, and a ſhame to ſuffer it. So a man may be made a foole indeed, and accounted a wretch, and a daſtard of no reputation. Neuer will any man care to ſerue me, if I ſticke not better to my men than ſo.</hi> Such language, as the world now goeth, is very rife among vs.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Abraham</hi> ſpake not ſo. Grace was in his face, and mildneſſe in his words: For thus ſpake he vnto his Nephew <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 13.8. <hi>I pray thee, let there be no ſtrife betweene thee and me; neither betweene thy heardmen and my heardmen; for we are brethren.</hi> We are <hi>brethren;</hi> I pray let there be no <hi>ſtrife</hi> betweene vs. Let vs be mindfull of the <hi>couenant</hi> wherein na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath vnited our affections; we are <hi>brethren:</hi> the bond of <hi>brotherhood</hi> and <hi>conſanguinity,</hi> let it moderate our paſſions; why ſhall we iarre and be at odds betweene our ſelues? Are we not <hi>brethren?</hi>

                  <p>An excellent patterne of imitation for all eſtates, high and low, rich and poore, one with another.

We muſt abſtaine, not only from raiſing <hi>ſtrife</hi> and debate our ſelues, but alſo from foſtering and cheriſhing it in others. Such was <hi>Abrahams</hi> choice. He would not maintaine his <hi>ſeruants</hi> againſt <hi>Lots ſeruants:</hi> he tooke it to be farre more credit for him to haue <hi>vnity</hi> and <hi>good loue,</hi> than the bitter effects of the contrary.</p>

                  <p>I will ſhut vp this point with the exhortation of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt.

According to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction it came to paſſe, ſaith <hi>Druſius,</hi> either in the war of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manaſſar</hi> againſt the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> or in the warre of <hi>Nabuchodono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.</hi> Yet this he affirmeth not. <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> beſieged <hi>Tyrus</hi>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:1736:96"/> three yeeres and three moneths, and then tooke its ſo ſaith <hi>Winckleman</hi> out of <hi>Ioſephus, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>contra Appionem:</hi> the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Copies of <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> which I haue ſeene, make mention of the continuance of this ſiege for <hi>thirteene yeeres.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Greeke Copy hath nothing of the continuance of it. For therein I read only, that when <hi>Thobalus</hi> was King, <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chodonoſor</hi> beſieged <hi>Tyrus.</hi> This was about the yeere of the world 3345. <hi>Tyrus</hi> after this was reedified and did flouriſh. But ſhe was in her pride againe beſieged, and taken by <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander the Great</hi> in the yeere of the world 3632. And long ſince, <hi>A. C.</hi> 1290. ſhe was ſacked &amp; leuelled with the ground by <hi>Alphix</hi> then <hi>Sultan</hi> of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Thus hath Gods hand been ſtrong and preuailing againſt <hi>Tyrus,</hi> according to the tenor of this Prophecie. The very words wherof you haue heard before expounded in the <hi>fourth</hi> and <hi>ſeuenth verſes</hi> of this <hi>Chapter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I pray you onely recount with me ſuch heads of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as heretofore haue beene obſerued out of theſe words: <hi>Therefore will I ſend a fire, &amp;c.</hi> Wherein three circumſtances are to be obſerued: 1 The puniſher. 2 The puniſhment. 3 The puniſhed.</p>
                  <p>The firſt circumſtance is the puniſher, the <hi>Lord:</hi> For thus ſaith the <hi>Lord, I will ſend]</hi> The Doctrine is:
<q>It is proper to the Lord to execute vengeance vpon the wicked for their ſins.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond circumſtance is the puniſhment, and that is by <hi>fire: I will ſend a fire]</hi> The Doctrine is:
<q>The fire, and all other creatures, are at the Lords comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, to bee employed by him in the puniſhment of the wicked.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third circumſtance is the puniſhed, <hi>the walls</hi> and <hi>pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of</hi> Tyrus: <hi>I will ſend a fire vpon the walls of</hi> Tyrus, <hi>and it ſhall deuoure the palaces thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, muſt the glorious City <hi>Tyrus</hi> be deſtroyed? The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>No munition can ſaue that City which God will haue deſtroyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, muſt the <hi>Walls</hi> of <hi>Tyrus</hi> be deuoured with the fire of Gods diſpleaſure? The doctrine is,
<q>
                        <pb n="181" facs="tcp:1736:96"/>It is the good bleſſing of God vpon a Kingdome, to haue walls, ſtrong holds, munitions, fortreſſes, and bulwarkes for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe againſt enemies.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, muſt the <hi>palaces</hi> of <hi>Tyrus</hi> be conſumed with the fire of Gods anger? The doctrine is;
<q>God depriueth vs of a great bleſſing when he taketh from vs our dwelling houſes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of theſe doctrines and their ſeuerall vſes, I haue hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this place at large entreated. Wherefore let this which hath beene now ſpoken, ſuffice for my preſent expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this prophecie againſt <hi>Tyrus.</hi>

                  <p>The Preface, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> challengeth your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>That <hi>brother</hi> that <hi>warreth</hi> with his <hi>brother,</hi> in <hi>Plutarch</hi> his iudgement, doth voluntarily<note n="h" place="margin">Ibid.</note> cut off a member of his owne fleſh.

Much more monſtrous will the <hi>ſtrife</hi> between brethren be; becauſe the aid which one of them may

                  <p>Examples Poeticall, Hiſtoricall, and Diuine, doe ſpeake as much. The implacable hatred of <hi>Atreus</hi> againſt <hi>Thyeſtes, Eteocles</hi> againſt <hi>Polynices, Romulus</hi> againſt <hi>Remus, Baſſianus</hi>

                  <p>Againſt ſuch monſtrous and prodigious contentions, the Holy Ghoſt would haue all Chriſtians well armed; and for this end giueth vs in holy writ many wholſome Leſſons. Let a few ſerue this time. In the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>S. Iohn, Cap.</hi> 2.11. we are taught that <hi>whoſoeuer hateth his brother, he is in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he walketh in darkneſſe, he knoweth not whither he goeth; darkneſſe hath blinded his eyes:</hi> and Chap. 3.15. that <hi>whoſoeuer hateth his brother is a man-ſlayer:</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.20. that <hi>whoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer hateth his brother is a lyer, if he ſaith he loueth God.</hi> The reaſon is annexed; <hi>For how can he that loueth not his brother, whom he hath ſeene, loue God whom hee hath not ſeene?</hi> And this commandement wee haue of <hi>Chriſt, that he that loueth God ſhould loue his brother alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the book of <hi>Prouerbs, Chap.</hi> 16.19. we read of <hi>ſix</hi> things which the <hi>Lord</hi> hateth, and of a <hi>ſeuenth</hi> which his ſoule ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth: that <hi>ſeuenth</hi> is, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. <hi>The man that raiſeth vp con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions among brethren.</hi> Now if God doe abhor with his ſoule the man that raiſeth vp contentions among brethren, how doth he like of the contentions themſelues?

                  </p>
                  <p>A ſecond vſe is, to worke in vs <hi>brotherly kindneſſe:</hi> that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, whereby euery good Chriſtian embraceth the Church of God and the members thereof with the bowels of loue. This <hi>brotherly kindneſſe, S. Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1.7. commendeth vnto vs, as whereto we ought <hi>to giue all diligence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 133.1. ſtileth it with the ſweet name of <hi>Vnity; Behold how good and comely a thing it is for brethren to liue in vnity.</hi> And therefore commendeth it by two ſimilitudes: in the one ſhewing the ſweetneſſe and pleaſantneſſe of it; in the other, the fruit and profit which commeth by it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>it is like that precious ointment,</hi> which was powred on the <hi>head</hi> of the high Prieſt, and <hi>ran downe vpon his heard,</hi> and ſo to the <hi>borders of his garments.</hi> Behold the ſweetneſſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſſe of <hi>vnity.</hi> That ſweet <hi>perfume</hi> and <hi>ointment,</hi> that <hi>holy o le</hi> powred out vpon the high Prieſt and his garment, was not only pleaſant and delightfull to himſelfe, but did alſo yeeld a ſweet ſmelling ſauour to all that were about him. So is it with <hi>vnity.</hi> It is not onely pleaſant to them, who doe religiouſly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme and keepe it, but to others alſo which are about them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is like <hi>the dew of</hi> Hermon, <hi>which fell vpon the mountaines of Sion; where the Lord appointed the bleſſing, and life foreuermore.</hi> Behold the fruit and profit which commeth by <hi>Vnity.</hi> The <hi>dew,</hi> and wet that fell downe from heauen vpon <hi>H rmon</hi> and <hi>Sion,</hi> made thoſe hils, and the plaine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries neere them, fertill: ſo doth <hi>Vnity</hi> bring with it great fruit
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1736:101"/> and profit. If makes them among whom it is ſincerely obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, it makes them through Gods bleſſing fruitfull and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull in good workes towards God, and in him and for him towards men, and one of them towards another. This <hi>vnity, concord, brotherly loue, mutuall conſent and agreement,</hi> if it bee vnfeigned, hath the promiſes both of this life and of that to come: of peace and quietneſſe in this life, and of eternall ioyes in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>One of the notes by which we may be aſſured of God his ſpeciall loue and fauour, is the <hi>loue of our brethren.</hi> Now that we deceiue not our ſelues in this loue, <hi>S. Iohn, Epiſt.</hi> 1. giues vs three rules to direct vs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Chriſtian brotherly loue</hi> muſt not be for any worldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects or conſiderations, but principally for and in God. We muſt <hi>loue our brethren</hi> principally becauſe they are the ſons of God and members of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This rule he intimateth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Euery one that loueth him which begat, loueth him alſo which is begotten of him:</hi> that is, whoſoeuer loueth God the Father, he loueth alſo the ſons of God; his naturall ſon <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> and his ſons by grace and adoption, all Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Chriſtian brotherly loue</hi> muſt not be outward in ſhew on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but inward in the heart. This rule he giueth vs, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Let vs not loue in word, nor in tongue onely, but in deed and in truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Chriſtian brotherly loue</hi> muſt be not onely in time of proſperity, but when moſt need is. This rule hee giueth <hi>verſ.</hi> the 17. <hi>Whoſoeuer hath this worlds good, and ſeeth his brother hath need, and ſhutteth vp his compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the loue of God in him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let theſe rules (beloued) be your direction. <hi>Loue</hi> ye euery one that is called a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> not becauſe he is rich or in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but becauſe he is a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> the ſon of God by grace and adoption. <hi>Loue</hi> ye him, not outwardly in ſhew only, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in heart, in deed, in truth. <hi>Loue</hi> him not only in his proſperous and flouriſhing eſtate, but in his greateſt need; and be ye aſſured that the ſpeciall <hi>loue</hi> and <hi>fauour of God</hi> will be your <hi>ſhield</hi> and <hi>protection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:1736:101"/>
                  <p>Three things there are that doe reioyce God, ſaith <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticus, Chap.</hi> 25.1. <hi>The vnity of brethren, the loue of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, a man and his wife agreeing together.</hi> The firſt, which is the <hi>vnity of brethren,</hi> according to my former conſtruction, compriſeth the other two. All Chriſtians are <hi>brethren in Chriſt, a neighbour</hi> to a <hi>neighbour,</hi> a <hi>husband</hi> to his <hi>wife,</hi> a <hi>wife</hi> to her <hi>husband.</hi> For, as I ſaid, in <hi>Chriſt</hi> there is no difference of <hi>ſex;</hi> there is neither <hi>male</hi> nor <hi>female;</hi> all are <hi>brethren in Chriſt;</hi> and therefore that <hi>neighbour</hi> that loueth not his <hi>neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> the <hi>husband</hi> that is at ods with his <hi>wife,</hi> the <hi>wife</hi> that agreeth not with her <hi>husband,</hi> they are guilty of the breach of <hi>brotherly loue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That exhortation made by <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Chap. 12.10. concerneth all of you, all, of both <hi>ſexes,</hi> without any difference: <hi>Be yee affectioned to loue one another with brotherly loue.</hi> I conclude this point with the ſame Apoſtles words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Now I beſeech you brethren, by the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that yee ſpeake all one thing, and that there be no diſſentions among you: Be of one minde; liue in peace, and the God of peace ſhall be with you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus farre of the firſt branch in the deſcription of <hi>Edoms</hi> ſinne, and of the doctrine grounded thereupon: The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was,
<q>It is a thing very distastefull, and vnpleaſing vnto God, for brethren to be at variance among themſelues.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was grounded vpon theſe words, <hi>He did purſue his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſword.</hi> It followeth:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And did caſt off all pity]</hi> or after the <hi>Hebrew</hi> text, <hi>did corrupt his compaſſions,</hi> which <hi>reading</hi> is expreſſed in the margin of our <hi>Church</hi> Bible, and the <hi>Geneua</hi> tranſlation. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſet out by <hi>Tyndall</hi> reades it otherwiſe: <hi>Hee deſtroyed his mothers wombe:</hi> and <hi>Winckleman</hi> reads it, <hi>Et violauerit vteru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> and violated or abuſed the mothers wombe: both doe allude to the Greeke edition of the <hi>Septuagent,</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>he did violate the mothers wombe;</hi> which <hi>reading</hi> may haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the natiuity of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> borne at one birth of their mother <hi>Rebekah.</hi> And then the meaning is, that the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1736:102"/> 
                     <hi>Edomites Eſau's</hi> poſterity, neglecting that bond and knot of <hi>brotherhood</hi> and <hi>conſanguinity,</hi> did exerciſe <hi>rigour</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi> againſt the <hi>Iſraelites, Iacobs</hi> poſterity: or it may haue reference to a ſauage and outragious <hi>cruelty,</hi> as if the <hi>Edomites</hi> were here noted for <hi>ripping vp mothers wombes,</hi> or <hi>women with childe in Iſrael.</hi> That ſuch cruelty was vſed by the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> it is plaine by the 13. verſe of this Chapter. But this Text in the <hi>originall</hi> doth not faſten this blame vpon the <hi>Edomites,</hi> and I loue not, to force my Text. I will not trouble you with other expoſitions.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>originall</hi> is: <hi>He did corrupt his compaſſions]</hi> The ſenſe and meaning is well rendred and deliuered in our receiued Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Bibles; <hi>He did eaſt off all pity.</hi> Is <hi>Edom</hi> here condemned for <hi>corrupting his compaſſions? for caſting off all pitie?</hi> The leſſon hence to bee commended to your Chriſtian conſiderations is this,
<q>Vnmercifulneſſe is a ſinne hatefull vnto God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I could bring you many places out of holy Writ for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this doctrine. But two only, or three, and they but touched, ſhall ſerue for this preſent. In <hi>Iob</hi> 6.14. the <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull</hi> are noted to <hi>haue forſaken the feare of the Almighty.</hi> In <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.31. among ſuch as God hath giuen vp to a <hi>reprobate minde</hi> to commit things worthy of death, the <hi>vnmercifull</hi> are named. In <hi>Iames</hi> 2.13. a puniſhment is denounced to the <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull; There ſhall be iudgement mercileſſe to him that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no mercy.</hi> Theſe few Texts of Scripture doe plentifully eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh my doctrine:
<q>Vnmercifulneſſe is a ſinne hatefull vnto God.</q>
                  </p>

There was a time when <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> ſeemed to be taken vp into the clouds, and the earth to be void of it. It was in the daies of the Prophet <hi>Eſay.</hi> He then cryed out, <hi>Chap.</hi> 45.8. <hi>O ye heauens, ſend the dew from aboue, and let the clouds drop downe righteouſneſſe.</hi> The time is now, when <hi>loue</hi> ſeemeth to be taken vp into the clouds, and the earth to bee void of it.

                  <p>But it may be that ſome are ſo farre from all <hi>humanity,</hi> that this prerogatiue of <hi>mankind</hi> will not moue them to doe any worke of charity. Such hard hearts let them heare what the Law is, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.7. <hi>If one of thy brethren with thee be poore, within any of thy gates in thy land which the Lord thy God giueth thee, thou ſhalt not harden thine heart, nor ſhut thine hand from thy poore brother: But thou ſhalt open thy hand vnto him, and ſhalt lend him ſufficient for his need.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know fleſh and bloud will oblect: Shall I lend my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſufficient for his need?

Looke backe vpon the bleſſing of God; rely vpon it: he through his benediction will make thee large recompence.</p>
                  <p>Of this thou maiſt be aſſured, if thou wilt haue recourſe to the fore-cited Chapter, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.10.

                  </p>
                  <p>My exhortation is no other than that of the Prophet <hi>Eſay, Chap.</hi> 58 7. <hi>Deale thy bread to the hungry: bring the poore wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer to thine houſe: If thou ſeeſt him naked, couer him; hee is thine owne fleſh; hide not thy ſelfe from him.</hi> Thy <hi>liberality</hi> will
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1736:103"/> bring thee great aduantage: whereof thou wilt not doubt if thou conſider the next verſe, <hi>Thy light ſhall breake forth as the morning; thy health ſhall grow ſpeedily: thy righteouſneſſe ſhall goe before thee; the glory of the Lord ſhall embrace thee.</hi> Seeſt thou not an heape of bleſſings one vpon another?</p>
                  <p>Looke into the booke of <hi>Pſalmes.</hi> In the beginning of the 41. <hi>Pſalme</hi> many a ſweet promiſe is made thee conditionally, that thou tender the <hi>poore mans</hi> caſe: <hi>The Lord ſhall deliuer thee in the time of trouble, he ſhall keepe thee and preſerue thee aliue; he ſhall bleſſe thee vpon the earth; he will not deliuer thee to the will of thine enemies: he will ſtrengthen thee vpon thy bed of ſorrow, and will make thy bed all the time of thy ſickneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I might weary you and my ſelfe in the purſuit of this point. Here I ſtop my courſe, with recommendation of one onely place, and that a very remarkable one, <hi>Prou.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Hee that hath mercy vpon the poore, lendeth to the Lord; and the Lord will recompence him that which he hath giuen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Behold and ſee how gracious and good the Lord is. If you ſhew pity and compaſſion vpon the <hi>poore,</hi> God will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence you to the full: yea, in the largeneſſe of his mercies hee will reward you plentifully.</p>
                  <p>It was a graue exhortation of a<note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Tobit</hi> to his ſonne <hi>Tobias. cap.</hi> 4.7.</note> father to his ſonne: <hi>Giue almes of thy ſubſtance, and when thou giueſt almes, let not thine eye be ennious, neither turne thy face from any poore, leſt that God turne his face from thee. Giue almes according to thy ſubſtance: if thou haue but a little, be not afraid to giue a little: So ſhalt thou lay vp a good ſtore for thy ſelfe againſt the day of neceſſity. Almes will deliuer thee from death; and will not ſuffer thee to come into the place of darkneſſe. Almes is a good gift before the moſt high to all them which vſe it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vſe it, I beſeech you in the bowels of our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Be ye not like <hi>Edom</hi> in my Text, <hi>Corrupt not your compaſſions;</hi> caſt not off all pity; ſuffer ye one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; loue as brethren; be pitifull, be courteous: doe ye good to all men, and faint not: great ſhall be your reward in Heauen.</p>
                  <p>This your ſeruice will be acceptable vnto <hi>God. God</hi> for it will giue you his bleſſing. <hi>God</hi> will bleſſe you for the time of

<q>Euery childe of God ought to keepe himſelfe vnspotted of anger.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you demand a reaſon hereof, I muſt repeat vnto you God his holy Commandement: <hi>Thou ſhalt doe no murther.</hi> In the name of <hi>murther,</hi> are inhibited all the kindes of <hi>anger</hi> aboue ſpecified; the <hi>anger</hi> that lurketh in the <hi>heart,</hi> the <hi>anger</hi> that ſhineth in the <hi>countenance,</hi> the <hi>anger</hi> that is manifeſted in <hi>words;</hi> whereto I adde that <hi>anger</hi> that breaketh into <hi>action.</hi> If you <hi>wound,</hi> or but <hi>ſtrike</hi> your neighbour; if you <hi>ſpeake bitterly</hi> againſt him; if you <hi>looke frowningly</hi> at him; if you <hi>hate</hi> him in heart, or be <hi>vnaduiſedly angry</hi> with him, you are before Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God <hi>guilty of murther.</hi> And for this cauſe, <hi>euery childe of God ought to keepe himſelfe vnspotted of anger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another reaſon of this doctrine may be drawne from the foule effects of <hi>anger.</hi> The<note n="i" place="margin">Peter de La Primadaye.</note> Author of the <hi>French Academie par.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 55 thus diſcourſeth of them: <hi>Anger</hi> is a vice that hath wonderfull effects in the body, and ſuch as are very vnbeſeeming a man. For, firſt of all, when the <hi>heart</hi> is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the <hi>bloud</hi> boileth round about it, and the <hi>heart</hi> is ſwolne, and puffed vp, whereupon followeth a continuall <hi>panting</hi> and

                  <p>Now to make ſome vſe of this doctrine. Shall I ſay, that this <hi>euill anger</hi> is a reigning <hi>euill</hi> among you? Your conſciences muſt needs beare me witneſſe, it is ſo.

O! what an account are yee one day to make before <hi>Chriſts</hi> Tribunall, euen for this one <hi>ſinne;</hi> vnleſſe in this your day you waſh it away with teares of penitencie.

                  </p>
                  <p>This twelfth <hi>verſe</hi> doth not much differ from ſome precedent <hi>verſes</hi> in this Chap. 4, 7, and 10. The ſame puniſhment which in the fourth verſe is threatned to the <hi>Syrians,</hi> vnder the names of <hi>Hazael,</hi> and <hi>Benhadad;</hi> and in the ſeuenth verſe to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines,</hi> vnder the name of <hi>Azzah;</hi> and in the tenth verſe to the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> vnder the name of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> is here in this twelfth verſe denounced to the <hi>Edomites,</hi> vnder the names of <hi>Teman</hi> and <hi>Bezzah.</hi> And therfore, as in the forenamed <hi>verſes</hi> I haue done, ſo doe I in this recommend vnto you three circumſtances.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 The puniſher: the <hi>Lord, I will ſend.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2 The puniſhment: by fire, <hi>I will ſend a fire.</hi>

                  </list>
                  <p>The puniſher, is the <hi>Lord;</hi> for, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord; I will ſend.</hi> The doctrine naturally ariſing hence is this;
<q>It is proper to the Lord to execute vengeance vpon the wicked for their ſinnes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This truth hath heretofore once, and againe, beene confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto you. The leſſe need haue I now to inſiſt vpon it. Yet may I not paſſe it ouer vnſaluted. <hi>It is proper to the Lord to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute vengeance,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
                  <p>This office of <hi>executing vengeance vpon the wicked for their ſinnes,</hi> God taketh vpon himſelfe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.35. Where hee ſaith, <hi>Vengeance and recompence are mine.</hi> This is confeſſed to be God his due by <hi>S. Paul, Rom.</hi> 12.19. <hi>It is written, vengeance is mine, I will repay, ſaith the Lord;</hi> and by the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> Chap. 10.30. <hi>Vengeance belongeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, I will recompenſe, ſaith the Lord;</hi> and by the ſweet Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>Iſrael, Pſal.</hi> 94.1. <hi>O Lord God the auenger, O God the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenger.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Nahum,</hi> Chap. 1.2. to the terrour of the wicked, proclaimeth it: <hi>God is iealous, and the Lord reuengeth: the Lord reuengeth: euen the Lord of anger; the Lord will take vengeance on his aduerſaries, and reſerueth wrath for his enemies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe places are ſo many pregnant proofes to make good my propounded doctrine, namely, that <hi>It is proper to the Lord to execute vengeance vpon the wicked for their ſinnes.</hi> Many are the vſes of this doctrine.</p>
                  <p>The firſt. It may leſſon vs to looke heedfully vnto out feet, that we walke not in the way of <hi>ſinners,</hi> to partake with them in their ſinnes. <hi>Sinnes</hi> are not tongue tied; they <hi>cry</hi> vnto the <hi>Lord</hi> for vengeance. We reade in holy writ of foure ſorts of ſinnes, which aboue other, doe <hi>cry</hi> vnto God, and doe call for his great and quicke vengeance.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is <hi>Homicide, murther,</hi> or <hi>man ſlaughter;</hi> whereof Almighty God, <hi>Geneſ</hi> 4 10. thus ſpeaketh vnto <hi>Caine; The voice of thy brothers bloud</hi> crieth <hi>vnto me from the earth.</hi>

<q>It is proper to the Lord to execute vengeance vpon the wicked for their ſinnes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much of the firſt vſe; which was to leſſon vs to looke heedfully to our feet, that we walke not in the way of ſinners, to partake with them in their ſinnes. I proceed.</p>
                  <p>Is it true? Is it <hi>proper to God to execute vengeance vpon the wicked for their ſinnes?</hi> Here then in the ſecond place we are
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:1736:113"/> admoniſhed, not to intermeddle in the <hi>Lords office.</hi> It is his <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> to <hi>execute vengeance.</hi> We therefore may not interpoſe our ſelues. If a brother, a neighbour, or a ſtranger hath done vs any wrong, we muſt <hi>forgiue</hi> him, and muſt leaue <hi>reuengement</hi> to God, to whom it appertaineth. We muſt leaue <hi>reuengement</hi> to God, to whom it appertaineth, and <hi>forgiue our enemies.</hi> What? <hi>Forgiue our enemies?</hi> How can <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>bloud</hi> endure it? Well, it ſhould be endured: and many reaſons there are to induce vs to ſo Chriſtian an office.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is; The <hi>forgiueneſſe of our owne ſinnes.</hi> Whereof thus ſaith our Sauiour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.37. <hi>Forgiue, and you ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen.</hi>

Looke what grace and indulgence we ſhew vnto our neighbours, the like will God ſhew vnto vs. What elſe is ſaid, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.38? <hi>With what meaſure you mete, with the ſame ſhall it be meaſured to you againe.</hi> Whereof I cannot giue a plainer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition than in our Sauiours words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.14, 15. <hi>If yee doe forgiue men their trespaſſes, your heauenly Father will alſo forgiue you. But if yee doe not forgiue men their trespaſſes, no more will your Father forgiue you your trespaſſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſecond reaſon why we ſhould <hi>forgiue our enemies,</hi> is, that <hi>when we make our prayers vnto God, we our ſelues may be heard.</hi> For God heareth not the prayers of ſuch as doe abide in ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and will not <hi>forgiue their enemies.</hi> It is well ſaid of an<note n="g" place="margin">Auguſtin.</note> Ancient: <hi>Qui non vult dimittere fratri ſuo, non ſperet oratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis effectum.</hi> Whoſoeuer he be that will not <hi>forgiue his brother,</hi> let him not hope for any good ſucceſſe in his prayer.<note n="h" place="margin">Ambroſ.</note> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaith: <hi>Si iniuriam non dimittis, quae tibi facta eſt; orationem pro te non facis, ſed maledictionem ſuper te inducis.</hi> If thou <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue</hi> not the iniury which thy neighbour hath done thee, when thou prayeſt, thou makeſt not any prayer for thy ſelfe, but doeſt bring a malediction, or curſe, vpon thy ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The moſt abſolute and excellent platforme of <hi>prayer,</hi> that euer was made, and is by the maker thereof, our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> commended vnto vs for our daily vſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:1736:114"/> this point vnto vs. The fifth petition therein, is, that God would be pleaſed to <hi>forgiue vs our trespaſſes, as we forgiue them that trespaſſe againſt vs.</hi> Wherefore, as in all ſincerity we deſire our ſelues to be looked vpon with the <hi>eyes</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> from heauen, without any fraud, or hollowneſſe, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation in the <hi>Lord:</hi> ſo are we taught by that clauſe, our ſelues to deale with others; ſo truly, ſo honeſtly, ſo heartily, ſo ſincerely, and vnfainedly forgiuing euer, as we may boldly ſay, <hi>So Lord, doe thou to mee, as I to others.</hi> Now if theſe hearts of ours be ſo ſturdy and ſtrong in their corruption, as that they will not relent, and yeeld to <hi>forgiue</hi> ſuch as haue <hi>trespaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs,</hi> how can we looke that our prayers ſhould take effect?</p>
                  <p>A third reaſon, why we ſhould <hi>forgiue our enemies,</hi> is, <hi>that our good workes may be acceptable vnto God.</hi> Let a man euery day doe as many <hi>good workes,</hi> as there are Stars in Heauen; yet as long as in <hi>heart</hi> he beareth <hi>hatred</hi> to his enemie, God will not accept any one of them. <hi>Munus non acceptatur, niſi antè diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia ab animo pellatur,</hi> ſaith <hi>Gregory;</hi> thy gift is no waies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto God, vnleſſe thy <hi>heart</hi> be firſt freed from <hi>diſcord.</hi> Let no man circumuent himſelfe, ſeduce himſelfe, deceiue himſelfe.<note n="i" place="margin">Auguſt ſerm. <hi>5.</hi> de S.

                     </gap>ſoeuer he offereth to God in <hi>Good workes,</hi> all will be loſt. Witneſſe <hi>S. Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Though I feed the poore with all my goods, and though I giue my body, that I be burned, and haue not loue, it profiteth me nothing.</hi> If then wee would haue our good workes pleaſing vnto God, wee muſt be reconciled to our neighbours. Our bleſſed <hi>Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt</hi> ſo aduiſeth vs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Goe thy way, firſt be reconciled to thy brother, then come and offer thy gift.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A fourth reaſon, why we ſhould <hi>forgiue our enemies,</hi> is, <hi>that our ſoules may liue:</hi> for by <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>rancour,</hi> wee <hi>ſlay</hi> our ſoules. Saint <hi>Iohn Epiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. auoweth it; that he <hi>whoſoeuer hateth his brother, is a man-ſlayer. Homicida eſt, ſcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet propriae animae,</hi> ſaith<note n="k" place="margin">Pet. de Pal. vbi ſupra.</note> one, he is a murtherer of his owne ſoule. An expoſition not abſolutely to be diſallowed, for as much as it followeth in the ſame verſe; <hi>Yee know that no man-ſlayer hath eternall life abiding in him.</hi> The <hi>life</hi> of the ſoule
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:1736:114"/> 
                     <hi>is loue;</hi> therefore he that <hi>loueth not,</hi> is <hi>dead.</hi> So ſaith the ſame bleſſed Apoſtle, <hi>Ep.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>Hee that loueth not his brother, abideth in death.</hi> And greater is the dammage by the loſſe of <hi>one ſoule,</hi> than of a <hi>thouſand bodies.</hi> The <hi>whole world</hi> in reſpect of <hi>one ſoule,</hi> is not to be eſteemed. This is proued by our Sauiours queſtion, <hi>Mark.</hi> 8.36. <hi>What ſhall it profit a man, though he ſhould win the whole world, if he loſe his owne ſoule?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A fift reaſon why we ſhould <hi>loue our enemies,</hi> is the <hi>reioycing of Saints and Angels. To loue our enemies</hi> is an infallible ſigne of our <hi>conuerſion.</hi> Now wee know by <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.7. that <hi>there ſhall be ioy in Heauen for one ſinner that conuerteth:</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> the 10. <hi>That there is ioy in the preſence of the Angels of God for one ſinner that conuerteth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus whether we reſpect the <hi>reioycing of Saints and Angels; or the life of our ſoules;</hi> or the <hi>acceptance of our good workes;</hi> or <hi>the fruit of our prayers;</hi> or <hi>the forgiueneſſe of our ſins;</hi> wee muſt <hi>loue our enemies:</hi> after <hi>S. Stephen</hi> his example, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.60. <hi>Lord lay not this ſin to their charge:</hi> after <hi>S. Paul</hi> his example, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.12, 13. <hi>We are reuiled, and yet we bleſſe: we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, and ſuffer it: we are euill ſpoken of, and we pray:</hi> after <hi>Chriſts</hi> example, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.34. <hi>Father forgiue them, for they know not what they doe.</hi> Adde hereto <hi>Chriſts</hi> Commandement, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. <hi>Loue your enemies; bleſſe them that curſe you; doe good to them that hate you; and pray for them that hurt you and perſecute you.</hi> Leaue ye <hi>vengeance</hi> to the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>vengeance;</hi> ſo ſhall ye be the vndoubted children of your heauenly Father. And thus farre of the ſecond vſe, which was to admoniſh vs, not to intermeddle in the <hi>Lords office</hi> of executing <hi>reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> A third followeth.</p>
                  <p>Is it true? <hi>Is it proper to the Lord to execute vengeance vpon the wicked for their ſinnes?</hi> Here then in the third place is a treaſury of <hi>comfort</hi> and of <hi>terror:</hi> of <hi>comfort</hi> to the godly, of <hi>terror</hi> to the wicked. For though the <hi>Lord</hi> doe vſe the wicked to correct the godly; yet will he in due time ouerthrow the wicked with a large meaſure of his iudgements, and free the godly. Gods holy practice in this kinde, muſt bee hereof a warrant vnto vs.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were kept in thraldome and bondage many yeeres by the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> The <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> they were but <hi>the weapons of Gods wrath,</hi> wherewith hee afflicted his people.

                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:1736:115"/> But I muſt haſten; and the aforementioned inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and his wife <hi>Iezebel,</hi> and of <hi>Daniels accuſers,</hi> are ſufficient to worke <hi>terror</hi> to the wicked, and to the godly <hi>comfort:</hi> and to aſſure vs, when the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhall ſhew himſelfe from Heauen with his holy Angels in fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire, that then to the wicked, whoſe behauiour to the <hi>godly</hi> hath beene proud and diſpiteous, he will render <hi>venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> and <hi>puniſh</hi> them with euerlaſting perdition. Thus farre of the firſt circumſtance and doctrine thereupon.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond circumſtance is the puniſhment, <hi>I will ſend a fire]</hi> By <hi>fire</hi> in this place, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 4, 7, 10. learned Expoſitors doe vnderſtand, not ſo much a <hi>naturall fire,</hi> as a <hi>figuratiue fire.</hi> For in the name of <hi>fire,</hi> they vnderſtand the ſword, peſtilence and famine, <hi>quodlibet genus conſumptionis,</hi> euery kind of conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>quamlibet ſpeciem excidij,</hi> euery kind of deſtruction; be it haile, or thunder, or ſickneſſe, or any other of Gods meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers. So large is the ſignification of <hi>fire</hi> taken <hi>figuratiuely.</hi> The Doctrine ariſing hence is this;
<q>The fire (<hi>whether</hi> naturall, <hi>or</hi> figuratiue) <hi>that is,</hi> the fire and all other creatures are at the Lords commandement, to be employed by him in the puniſhment of the wicked.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Doctrine hath heretofore beene commended and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed vnto you.</p>
                  <p>The vſe of it is, to teach vs how to behaue our ſelues at ſuch times as God ſhall <hi>viſit</hi> vs with his <hi>rod</hi> of corrections: how to carry our ſelues in all our <hi>afflictions.</hi> Wee muſt not ſo much looke to the <hi>inſtruments,</hi> as to the <hi>Lord</hi> that ſmiteth by them. If the <hi>fire,</hi> or <hi>water,</hi> or any other of Gods creatures ſhall at any time rage, and preuaile againſt vs, we muſt remember that it is God that ſendeth them to work his holy will vpon vs. Here he ſent <hi>a fire</hi> vpon <hi>Teman</hi> and vpon <hi>Bozrah</hi> to <hi>deuoure her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces.</hi> For <hi>thus ſaith the Lord: I will ſend a fire vpon</hi> Teman, <hi>and it ſhall deuoure the palaces of</hi> Bozrah.</p>
                  <p>Here haue you the third circumſtance; the circumſtance of the puniſhed: <hi>Teman</hi> and the <hi>palaces of</hi> Bozrah. <hi>Teman</hi> was the Metropolitan, the chiefe City of <hi>Idumaea,</hi> ſo named from <hi>Teman,</hi> who was ſon of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Eſau, Gen.</hi> 36.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:1736:116"/> 10, 11. Renowned and famous was <hi>Teman</hi> for her wiſdome; witneſſe the Prophecie of <hi>Obadiah, verſ.</hi> 8.9. and <hi>Ierem.</hi> 49.7. whereby it is credible, ſhee omitted no opportunity, no meanes to make her ſelfe ſtrong by bulwarkes and fortreſſes, againſt whatſoeuer incurſion or ſiege of enemies. Yet could ſhe not hereby be ſecured againſt the day of <hi>Gods viſitation;</hi> when for the complement of her ſins, God ſhould lay his heauy <hi>rod</hi> vpon her. What the wit of man could inuent for ſafety, no doubt but <hi>Teman</hi> had it. But what can mans wit doe againſt the <hi>Almighty?</hi> Behold here in my Text, thus ſaith the <hi>Almighty: I will ſend a fire vpon</hi> Teman. And can all the water of the huge Ocean quench the <hi>fire</hi> of the <hi>Almighty?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This reſolution of the <hi>Lord</hi> for the ouerthrow of <hi>Teman,</hi> is excellently ſet downe by the Prophet <hi>Obadiah, verſ.</hi> 8, 9, 10. <hi>Shall not I in that day, ſaith the Lord, euen deſtroy the wiſe men out of</hi> Edom, <hi>and vnderſtanding from the mount of</hi> Eſau? <hi>And thy ſtrong men, O</hi> Teman, <hi>ſhall be afraid, becauſe euery one of the mount of</hi> Eſau <hi>ſhall bee cut off by ſlaughter.

Is their wiſdome vaniſhed?</hi> As if he had ſaid, the wiſdome of <hi>Teman</hi> is become fooliſhneſſe; their counſell is nothing worth. And why? But becauſe, as my Text ſaith, <hi>God will ſend a fire vpon</hi> Teman. The doctrine hence ariſing is:
<q>No wiſdome, no counſell, no humane inuention can ſaue that City which God will haue deſtroyed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon hereof is; becauſe there is no <hi>ſtrength,</hi> but of God and from God.

                  <p>The Prophecie conſiſteth of foure parts:
<list>
                        <item>1 A generall accuſation of the <hi>Ammonites;</hi> who are here noted as reproueable for many ſinnes: <hi>For three tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of the children of</hi> Ammon, <hi>and for foure.</hi>

                        </item>
                        <item>3 A particular declaration of one ſinne, which with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers procured this Prophecie. This ſinne was the ſinne of <hi>cruelty,</hi> expreſſed in theſe words: <hi>Becauſe they haue ript vp the women with childe of</hi> Gilead: and ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the end of ſo foule a fact: <hi>That they might enlarge their borders.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4 A denuntiation of iudgement, which was to come vpon them deſeruedly for their ſinnes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. and 15. This iudgement is ſet downe,</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly with ſome circumſtances: as, that it ſhould be full of <hi>terror,</hi> and <hi>ſpeedy.</hi> Full of <hi>terror</hi> in theſe words; <hi>With ſhou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the day of battell. Speedy</hi> in the words following: <hi>With a tempeſt in the day of the whirlewind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This iudgement is further amplified by the <hi>extent</hi> of it. It was to fall vpon, not only the meaner ſort of the people, but vpon the Nobility alſo; yea, and vpon the <hi>King</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.

Such readineſſe well becommeth euery childe of God, euen at this day in the Church where God ſpeaketh. Thus muſt he thinke within himſelfe: It is thine ordinance, O Lord, by thy word <hi>preached,</hi> to inſtruct me concerning thy holy will: <hi>I am here Lord,</hi> in all humble feare, to heare thy bleſſed pleaſure, what this day it ſhall pleaſe thee to put in the mouth of the <hi>Preacher</hi> to deliuer vnto me: <hi>I am here, ſpeake on Lord, thy ſeruant heareth.</hi>

<q>Many ſinnes doe plucke downe from heauen the moſt certaine wrath and vengeance of God vpon the ſinners.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God is of pure eies, and beholdeth not iniquity. Hee hath laid righteouſneſſe to the rule, and weighed his iuſtice in a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance.

God makes it good by an oath, <hi>Deut.</hi> 3.2.41. <hi>That he will whet his glittering ſword, and his hand ſhall take hold on iudgement, to execute vengeance for ſin.</hi> His ſoule hateth and abhorreth ſin; his law curſeth and condemneth ſin; his hand ſmiteth and ſcourgeth ſin. Sinne was his motiue to caſt downe Angels into Hell; to thruſt <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe; to turne cities into aſhes; to ruinate nations; to torment his owne bowels in the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh. Becauſe of ſinne hee
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:1736:120"/> drowned the old world; and becauſe of ſinne ere long will burne this. Thus doe many ſinnes plucke, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>One vſe of this doctrine is, to teach vs heedfulneſſe in all our wayes; that we doe not by <hi>our many ſinnes</hi> prouoke Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God to high diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond vſe is, to moue vs to a ſerious contemplation of the wonderfull patience of Almighty God, who did ſo graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbeare theſe <hi>children of Ammon,</hi> till by <hi>three and foure tranſgreſſions,</hi> by <hi>their many ſins</hi> they prouoked him to indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.

The <hi>women</hi> vpon whom this <hi>cruelty</hi> was practiſed, are here ſaid to haue beene of <hi>Gilead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of this land of <hi>Gilead</hi> I haue heretofore largely ſpoken in my <hi>ſeuenth Lecture</hi> vpon this prophecie, occaſioned by the 3. ver. of this chapter, where it is obiected to the <hi>Syrians</hi> of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> that they <hi>threſhed</hi> Gilead <hi>with threſhing inſtruments of iron.</hi> Then I ſhewed, that the land of <hi>Gilead</hi> was poſſeſſed by the <hi>Reubenites, Gadites,</hi> and <hi>halfe tribe of Manaſſeh, Num.</hi> 32.33. Whereby it is plaine, that the <hi>Gileadites</hi> were <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.</hi> Here then theſe <hi>women,</hi> with whom the <hi>Ammonites</hi> dealt ſo barbarouſly, as to <hi>rip them vp,</hi> when they were <hi>great with childe,</hi> were of <hi>Iacobs</hi> poſterity: they were <hi>Jſraelites,</hi> the <hi>lot</hi> and <hi>portion of Gods owne inheritance.</hi> For ſo prodigious a <hi>cruelty,</hi> we ſee Almighty God is here reſolued to be auenged on the <hi>children of Ammon.</hi> The doctrine ariſing hence is this;
<q>Cruelty is a ſinne very hatefull vnto God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This doctrine I haue heretofore out of this place confirmed vnto you: it is alſo plainly grounded vpon my text, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I paſſe it ouer.</p>

If you offend but in the leaſt of theſe, your are guilty of <hi>cruelty,</hi> and doe tranſgreſſe Gods holy commandements, <hi>the ſixt commandement,</hi> wherein you are forbidden to doe <hi>murther.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore (beloued in the Lord) put you on the tender bowels of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>compaſſion:</hi> let <hi>cruelty</hi> be farre from you. My exhortation vnto you, and concluſion of this point, ſhall be in the words of <hi>S. Paul, Coloſſ.</hi> 3.12, 13. <hi>Now as the elect of God, holy and beloued, put on tender mercy, kindneſſe, humbleneſſe of minde, meekneſſe, long ſuffering; forbearing one another, and forgiuing one another, if any man haue a quarrell to another: as Chriſt forgaue you, euen ſo doe yee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words of my text; <hi>They haue ript vp women with childe of</hi> Gilead, doe yeeld vs another profitable doctrine. <hi>They,</hi> that is, <hi>the children of Ammon,</hi> profeſſed enemies to God and godlineſſe, haue raged againſt the <hi>Gileadites, Iacobs</hi> poſterity, the <hi>lot</hi> and <hi>portion of Gods inheritance,</hi> euen to the <hi>ripping vp of their women with childe.</hi> The doctrine is;
<q>God often humbleth his choſen children vnder the rod of the wicked.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This truth appeareth in <hi>Lot,</hi> ſore preſſed vpon by the <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, Gen.</hi> 19.9. in the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> hardly dealt with by the <hi>Egyptians, Exod.</hi> 1.11. in the <hi>ſeuenty brethren,</hi> ſonnes of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbaal,</hi> perſecuted by <hi>Abimelech,</hi> moſt of them to the death, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 9.5. in <hi>Ieremie</hi> twice euill intreated, firſt <hi>beaten</hi> and <hi>put in the ſtockes by Paſhure, Ierem.</hi> 20.2. and a ſecond time <hi>beaten</hi> and <hi>impriſoned</hi> by <hi>Zedechias</hi> his Nobles, <hi>chap.</hi> 37.15. in the <hi>three children,</hi> caſt into the fiery furnace by <hi>Nabuchodonoſor, Dan.</hi> 3.21.</p>
                  <p>Many like examples might bee extracted out of Gods holy reg ſter for proofe of this point: which alſo may be made fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to appeare vnto you, in thoſe bloudy perſecutions after Chriſt his death, by the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, who deuiſed
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:1736:122"/> ſtrange torments to keepe downe religion, and religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours, men and women. <hi>They plucked off their skinnes quicke: they beared out their eyes with wimbles: they broyled them aliue on gredirons: they ſcalded them in boyling liquors: they encloſed them in barrels, through which great nailes were driuen, and therein they tumbled them downe mountaines, till their owne bloud ſo cruelly drawne out, had ſtifled and choaked them in the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels: womens breſts were ſeared off with burning irons, their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were rent, and their ioynts racked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sundry other, and as ſtrange kindes of torments were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured by the faithfull in the time of the <hi>ten firſt perſecutions</hi> in the primitiue Church. This is it which S. <hi>Peter</hi> hath <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>The time is come that iudgement muſt begin at the houſe of God.</hi> Yet let not the faithfull hereat be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. It is for their good. <hi>Iob,</hi> an vpright and a iuſt man, one that feared God, and eſchewed euill, vpon his experience of the afflictions which he endured vnder the rod of Gods cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>chap.</hi> 5.17. ſaith, <hi>Behold, bleſſed is the man whom God correcteth: therfore refuſe not thou the chaſtening of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For he maketh the wound, and bindeth it vp; he ſmiteth, and his hands make whole.</hi> And thus from my doctrine, I proceed to the vſes. I will but point at them.</p>
                  <p>Is it true (beloued?) Doth God often <hi>humble his choſen children vnder the rod of the wicked?</hi> It may firſt ſhew vs, how great Gods <hi>anger</hi> is for ſinne, that he puniſheth it ſo ſeuerely euen in his <hi>deareſt children,</hi> and thereby may worke in vs a <hi>loathing, hatred,</hi> and <hi>deteſtation of ſinne.</hi> Neuer more need than now, to ſmite our breſts, and pray with the Publicane, <hi>O God, be mercifull vnto vs ſinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it may teach vs not to meaſure the <hi>fauour of God</hi> towards our ſelues or others, by the <hi>aduerſities</hi> or <hi>croſſes</hi> of this life. Here we ſee that the <hi>women of Gilead</hi> of the race of <hi>Iſrael</hi> Gods owne <hi>lot</hi> and <hi>inheritance,</hi> were moſt barbarouſly and <hi>cruelly ript vp by the Ammonites.</hi> Yet are we not to doubt, but that <hi>Gods fauour</hi> was great towards them, euen in this ſeuere puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it may make vs powre out our ſoules in thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sennacherib</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> was a ſtout offended in this kinde. Hee boaſted of his inuaſions and victories vpon his neighbour countries. But that other Princes may take exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by him, he was made a peculiar example of diuine iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For as he trangreſſed the <hi>bounds</hi> of his neighbor Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to their ouerthrow, ſo did his owne ſons tranſgreſſe the <hi>bounds</hi> of nature, to the loſſe of his their fathers life.

                  <q>The nation that is not content with her owne borders, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uadeth her neighbour countries, ſinneth grieuouſly.</q>
                  <p>The vſe of this Doctrine may concerne vs here aſſembled. As Princes ought to hold themſelues contented with their owne <hi>bounds,</hi> ſo ought euerie priuate man alſo.

                  <p>But (beloued in the Lord) how do we ſtand to this order, ſet by Almightie God? Do we not ſeek daily to peruert it? God would haue it kept moſt holy; but we care not for it.

Crie, ye daughters of</hi> Rabbah, <hi>gird you with ſacke-cloth; mourne, and run to and fro by the hedges: for their King ſhall goe into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, and his Prieſts and his Princes likewiſe.</hi> And <hi>Ezechiel, Chap.</hi> 25.5. <hi>I will make</hi> Rabbah <hi>a dwelling place for Camels, and the Ammonites a ſheep coat.</hi>

                  <p>By which two places of <hi>Jeremie</hi> and <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> the meaning of my Prophet is opened.

                  <p>Muſt <hi>Rabbah,</hi> the chiefe Citie of the Kingdome, be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the line of deſolation? It yeelds vs this Doctrine,
<q>It is not the greatneſſe of a Citie that can be a ſafeguard vnto it, if God his vnappeaſable wrath breake out againſt it, for its ſinnes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For confirmation of this Doctrine, I need not ſend you to the <hi>old world,</hi> to behold the <hi>ruines</hi> of cities there. There may you ſee the <hi>citie</hi> which <hi>Caine</hi> built, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 4.17.) and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer other <hi>cities</hi> were erected between that time and the floud, you may ſee them all ſwept away with the floud.

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:1736:129"/> with ſhouting in the day of battell,</hi> wee may take this leſſon,
<q>God ſendeth warre vpon a Land for the ſinnes of a people.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For proofe of this truth, let vs looke into the word of truth. In the 26. of <hi>Leuit. verſ.</hi> 25. thus ſaith the <hi>Lord</hi> vnto <hi>Iſrael: If yee walke ſtubbornly againſt me, and will not obey me, then I will ſend a ſword vpon you, that ſhall auenge the quarrell of my coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> And <hi>Ierem.</hi> 5.15. vnto the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thus ſaith the <hi>Lord; Loe, I will bring a Nation vpon you from farre.</hi> You heare the <hi>Lord</hi> ſpeaking in his owne perſon, <hi>I will ſend, I will bring,</hi> as here, <hi>I will kindle.</hi> Will you any other witneſſe?</p>
                  <p>Then heare what <hi>Moſes</hi> telleth the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Deut. 28.49. <hi>The Lord ſhall bring a nation vpon you from farre, from the end of the world, flying as an Eagle: a nation, whoſe tongue thou ſhalt not vnderſtand, a nation of a fierce countenance, which will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the perſon of the old, nor haue compaſſion on the young: the ſame ſhall eat the fruit of thy cattell, and the fruit of thy land, vntill thou be deſtroyed: and he ſhall leaue thee neither wheat, nor wine, nor oile, nor the increaſe of thy kine, nor the flockes of thy ſheepe, vntill he haue brought thee to nought.</hi> By this ſpeech of <hi>Moſes,</hi> we plainly ſee that <hi>warre,</hi> and all the <hi>euills</hi> of <hi>warre,</hi> are from the <hi>Lord:</hi> that <hi>warre</hi> is<note n="r" place="margin">Cominaeus Hiſt. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> one of the accompliſhments of Gods iudgements, and that it is ſent by God vpon a Land for the ſinnes of the people, as my doctrine goeth. Let vs now make ſome vſe of it.</p>
                  <p>Is it true, beloued? Doth God ſend <hi>warre</hi> vpon a Land, <hi>for the ſinnes of a people?</hi> How then can we looke that the happy <hi>peace,</hi> which we now enioy, ſhould be continued among vs, ſith by our daily ſinning wee prouoke Almightie God vnto diſpleaſure?</p>
                  <p>Let the conſideration hereof lead vs to <hi>repentance. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> the gift of God, the ioy of Angels, the ſalue of ſinnes, the hauen of ſinners, let vs poſſeſſe it in our hearts. The Angels of heauen need it not, becauſe they ſinne not: the Deuills in Hell care not for it; for their iudgement is ſealed. It only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth to the ſonnes of men; and therefore let vs, the ſons of men, poſſeſſe it in our hearts: that is, let vs truly and vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly forſake our old ſinnes, and turne vnto the <hi>Lord</hi> our <hi>God,</hi>
                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:1736:129"/> ſo ſhall this bleſſed <hi>peace,</hi> and all other good things be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued among vs.</p>
                  <p>But if we will perſiſt in our euill wayes, not regarding what the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhall ſpeake vnto vs, either in <hi>his holy Word,</hi> or by <hi>his faithfull Miniſters,</hi> we may expect the <hi>portion</hi> of theſe <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> that God ſhould <hi>kindle a fire in our Rabbahs;</hi> our beſt fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced cities, which <hi>ſhall deuoure the palaces thereof, with ſhouting in the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>With a tempeſt in the day of the whirle-wind]</hi> Suiting hereto is the reading of <hi>Mercer, cum tempeſtate in die turbinis:</hi> and that of <hi>Tremelius: cum procella in die turbinis,</hi> with a ſtorme or tempeſt in the day of the whirle-wind. <hi>Caluin</hi> hath, <hi>in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine in die tempeſtatis:</hi> in a whirle-wind in a day of tempeſt: <hi>Brentius, in turbine, &amp; in die tempeſtatis;</hi> in a whirle-wind, and in a day of tempeſt: <hi>Gualter, cum turbine in die tempeſtatis,</hi> with a whirle-wind in a day of tempeſt. And this reading <hi>Druſius</hi> rather approueth, than the former.</p>
                  <p>Take which you will; the meaning is one and the ſame: namely, that the <hi>warre</hi> here denounced to the <hi>Ammonites</hi> in the former clauſe, ſhould come vpon them, <hi>tanquam turbo in die tempeſtatis,</hi> like vnto a whirle-wind in a tempeſtuous and ſtormie day. <hi>Turbine nihil celerius;</hi> a whirle-wind comes <hi>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly</hi> and <hi>with ſpeed;</hi> ſo was this <hi>warre</hi> to come vpon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Ammon.</hi> Thus haue we the meaning of our Prophet: let vs now take a view of ſuch doctrines, as may from hence be taken for our further inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, whereas the puniſhment here threatned to the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites,</hi> is to come vpon them <hi>with a whirle-wind in a day of tempest,</hi> in a tempeſtuous and ſtormie day, wee may learne, that,
<q>Stormes, Tempeſts, Whirle-winds, and the like, are the Lords creatures, ready at his command to be employed by him in the auenging of his quarrell againſt ſinners.</q>

                  <p>Well therefore is it ſaid of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 148.8. of <hi>fire,</hi> and <hi>haile,</hi> and <hi>ſnow,</hi> and <hi>vapours,</hi> and <hi>ſtormy winds,</hi> that they <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute Gods word;</hi> they are all ready at his commandement, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute what he will haue them to doe. <hi>Winds</hi> and <hi>tempeſts,</hi> they depend not vpon <hi>chance,</hi> or <hi>blinde fortune;</hi> but on the <hi>ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power</hi> of the Almighty Creator. So true is my doctrine;
<q>Stormes, Tempeſts, Whirle-winds, and the like, are the Lords creatures, ready at his command, to be employed by him in the auenging of his quarrell againſt ſinners.</q>
                  </p>

                  <p>Be it <hi>Melchom,</hi> or <hi>Milchom,</hi> or <hi>Molech,</hi> or <hi>Moloch;</hi> al is one. It is but an <hi>Idoll.</hi> So it is called by the Author of the <hi>vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Latine, Leuit.</hi> 18.21. <hi>De ſemine tuo non dabis, vt conſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Idolo</hi> Moloch. Thou ſhalt not giue thy children to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate them, to offer them to the Idoll <hi>Moloch.</hi> It is the <hi>abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Ammonites.</hi> So it is called, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.5. where it is ſaid of old <hi>Salomon,</hi> peruerted by his wiues, that he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Milchom,</hi> the <hi>abomination of the Ammonites;</hi> and verſ. 7. that he built an high place vnto <hi>Molech,</hi> the <hi>abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the children of Ammon.</hi> It is the <hi>God of the children of Ammon.</hi> So it is called, verſ. 33. where it is giuen for a reaſon, why the <hi>Lord</hi> would rent from <hi>Salomon</hi> the kingdom of <hi>Iſrael, becauſe he forſooke the Lord, and worſhipped</hi> Milchom, <hi>the god of the Ammonites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee what <hi>Melchom</hi> is. It is the <hi>god</hi> of the <hi>Ammonites;</hi> not the <hi>true God;</hi> for he is the <hi>God of all the world;</hi> but the <hi>God of the Ammonites;</hi> an <hi>abomination,</hi> an <hi>Idoll.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet did they worſhip it. But how? <hi>Moſes</hi> tells you, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.31. <hi>They burnt their ſonnes and daughters with fire, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to their gods.</hi> This abomination of the <hi>Painyme</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, hatefull to the <hi>liuing God,</hi> ſpread it ſelfe, euen to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting of the Lords people. For to the <hi>children of Iſrael,</hi> and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:1736:132"/> to the <hi>children of Iudah,</hi> it is obiected, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.35. That <hi>they built the high places of</hi> Baal, <hi>which are in the valley of</hi> Ben-hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom, <hi>to cauſe their ſonnes, and their daughters to paſſe thorow the fire of</hi> Molech. And the expoſtulation of God with the houſe of <hi>Iſrael, Ezech.</hi> 20.30. layes this home vnto them: <hi>Are yee not polluted after the manner of your fathers? Commit yee not whoredome after their abominations? For when you offer your gifts, and make your ſonnes to paſſe thorow the fire, you pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute your ſelues with your</hi> Idols.</p>
                  <p>It is regiſtred among the praiſes of good <hi>King Ioſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.10. that <hi>he defiled</hi> (or put downe, and deſtroyed) <hi>Topheth, which was in the valley of the children of</hi> Hinnom, <hi>that no man ſhould make his ſonne, or his daughter paſſe thorow the fire of</hi> Molech.</p>
                  <p>By this which hath beene ſpoken, you ſee what <hi>Melchom</hi> is, and how it was worſhipped. An <hi>Idoll-god</hi> worſhipped with the effuſion of the bloud of innocents; mens ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were conſecrated vnto it thorow fire.</p>
                  <p>So haue you two readings of my text: one, <hi>Their King ſhall goe into captiuitie, he, and his Princes together:</hi> the other, <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chom ſhall goe into captiuitie,</hi> &amp;c. Let vs now ſee, what profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble doctrines may be taken from either, for our further inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the reformation of our liues.</p>
                  <p>The firſt reading is according to the <hi>Hebrew, Their King ſhall goe into captiuity, he, and his Princes together:</hi> according to the Septuagint, <hi>Their King ſhall goe into captiuity, their Prieſts, and Princes likewiſe.</hi> The doctrine ariſing hence, is,
<q>When God puniſheth a nation with captiuitie for their ſinnes, he ſpareth neither Prieſts, nor Prince, nor King.</q>

                     <hi>captiuitie</hi> is an effect, or puniſhment of ſin, I haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore made plaine vnto you, in my 11. Lecture vpon this firſt Chapter of <hi>Amos. Salomon</hi> ſaith it, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.46. <hi>When a people ſinneth againſt the Lord, and the Lord is angry with them, the Lord deliuereth them vp to be caried away priſoners into the land of their enemies.</hi> It is affirmed, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.1. That the <hi>Iſraelites were caried away to</hi> Babylon <hi>for their tranſgreſſions.</hi> And <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.41. among the <hi>curſes</hi> threatned to ſuch, as will not obey the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:1736:133"/> voice of the <hi>Lord</hi> their God, <hi>Captiuity</hi> is reckoned. <hi>Thou ſhalt beget ſonnes and daughters, but ſhalt not haue them; for they ſhall goe into captiuity.</hi> Looke backe but to the fifth verſe of this Chapter: there ſhall you finde it denounced againſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Aram,</hi> that <hi>they ſhall goe into captiuity.</hi> And why? But <hi>for</hi> their <hi>three and foure tranſgreſſions,</hi> for their many ſinnes, and ſpecially for <hi>threſhing</hi> Gilead <hi>with threſhing inſtruments of iron?</hi> As you haue heard out of the third verſe. Thus you ſee againe that <hi>captiuity</hi> is an effect or puniſhment of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>This puniſhment reſteth not vpon the meaner ſort of the people, it reacheth to the higheſt: to the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> to the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> himſelfe. Of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> carried away into <hi>captiuity,</hi> you will make no doubt, when you ſee the ſame proued of <hi>Kings.</hi> Yet may you know by 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.27. that the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> when he had vanquiſhed <hi>Hoſeah,</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> did carry into captiuitie <hi>the Prieſts of Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You vnderſtand of <hi>Prieſts</hi> carried into captiuity: ſee now the like of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes.</hi> See 2 <hi>King.</hi> 24.14. It is a very eminent place. There it is affirmed of <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> King of <hi>Babel,</hi> that <hi>he carried away all Ieruſalem, and all the Princes, and all the ſtrong men of warre, euen ten thouſand, into captiuity;</hi> and in the verſe following, that <hi>he carried away King</hi> Iehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim (<hi>King of</hi> Iudah) <hi>into</hi> Babel, <hi>and the Kings mother, and the Kings wiues, and the Eunuches, and the mighty of the Land car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried he away into captiuity, from</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>to</hi> Babel. <hi>And all the men of war, euen ſeuen thouſand, and carpenters and lock-ſmiths a thouſand, all that were ſtrong and apt for war, did the King of</hi> Babel <hi>bring to</hi> Babel <hi>captiues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I could tell you of the like miſery befallen other Kings of <hi>Iudah;</hi> of <hi>King Manaſſeh,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.11. how he <hi>was taken by the hoaſt of the King</hi> Aſhur, <hi>was put in fetters, was bound in chaines, and was carried to</hi> Babel. And of <hi>King Zedekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 25.5. how he was <hi>taken in the deſerts of</hi> Iericho <hi>by the army of the</hi> Chaldees, <hi>had his eyes put out, was bound in chaines, and carried vnto</hi> Babel.</p>
                  <p>But what need I amplifie this point? By the places already brought, you ſee my doctrine eſtabliſhed: namely,
<q>
                        <pb n="255" facs="tcp:1736:133"/>When God puniſheth a nation with captiuity for their ſinnes, he ſpareth neither Prieſt, nor Prince, nor King.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it true, Beloued? Doth God puniſh a nation with capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity for their ſins? Let vs make this Chriſtian vſe of it, euen to powre out our ſoules in thankfulneſſe before Almighty God for his wonderfull patience towards vs. The ſins of ſuch Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as haue beene puniſhed with <hi>captiuity,</hi> were they more heinous in Gods eyes than ours are? Dearely beloued, far be it from vs to iuſtifie our ſelues. Let the example of the <hi>proud Phariſee</hi> be a warning to vs. He for all his ſmooth prayer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11. <hi>[O God I thanke thee, that I am not as other men; extortioners, vniuſt, adulterers, or euen as the Publican: I faſt twice in the weeke, I giue tithe of all that euer I poſſeſſe:]</hi> For all this his ſmooth prayer, he found no fauour with God. No maruell. For his heart was ſwolne with pride: with pride towards God, towards his neighbour, and in himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gracias ago,</hi> O God I thank thee] there was his pride towards God: <hi>Non ſum ſicut caeteri,</hi> I am not as other men] There was his pride towards his neighbour: <hi>Ieiuno bis in ſabbato,</hi> I faſt twice in the weeke] There was his pride in himſelfe. <hi>O God I thanke thee]</hi> He is not reprehended for giuing thanks to God, but for his proud and preſumptuous boaſting of himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The great Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> prayeth leaue to ſpeake vnto the <hi>Lord,</hi> and giues a reaſon of his requeſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.27. <hi>I am but duſt and aſhes:</hi> ſo lowly was <hi>Abraham</hi> conceited of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe when he was to ſpeake to God. But this Phariſee puffed vp and ſwolne with pride, boaſteth as though hee were not made of the ſame mould with other men: <hi>O God I thanke thee I am not as other men, &amp;c.</hi> But leaue we the <hi>Phariſee</hi> in his pride: he is not to be a patterne of imitation for vs.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Let the conſideration hereof (beloued) worke in vs a vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy to keepe the proud Deuill vnder, that we ſwell not vp through a vaine perſwaſion of fleſhly righteouſneſſe, that we lift not vp our Peacocks feathers, nor extoll our eye lids through a conceit of our owne deſerts, but in all humility pray we euer with the Publican; <hi>O God bee mercifull vnto vs ſinners;</hi> and aſcribe we vnto him all laud and praiſe for ſuffring vs (notwithſtanding our manifold <hi>ſins</hi>) euery man to dwell<note n="d" place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 4.25.</note> vnder his vine, and vnder his fig-tree, to liue in our owne land in peace, free from all feare of being led into <hi>captiuity.</hi> Thus much of my firſt vſe.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond followeth. My Doctrine was,
<q>When God puniſheth a nation with captiuity for their ſinnes, he ſpareth neither Prieſt, nor Prince, nor King.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Will you haue a reaſon hereof? Heare then what <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>Iob</hi> 34.19. <hi>God accepteth not the perſons of Princes, he regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not the rich more than the poore: Hee accepteth no mans perſon,</hi> ſaith <hi>S. Paul, Gal.</hi> 2.6. <hi>No mans perſon?</hi> Then neither the <hi>perſon</hi> of the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> nor of the <hi>King.</hi> If theſe <hi>ſinne</hi> like others of the people, theſe ſhall be <hi>puniſhed</hi> as well as others; and if others bee <hi>carried into captiuity,</hi> theſe muſt <hi>into captiuity</hi> alſo.</p>
                  <p>The vſe of this Doctrine is to admoniſh the great and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ones of this world, that they preſume not to ſinne againſt the <hi>Lord,</hi> as if they were priuiledged by their greatneſſe and might. No priuiledge can ſerue their turnes, when they muſt<note n="e" place="margin">

                     <hi>drinke of the wrath of the Almighty.</hi> Then ſhall they be <hi>as</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Conſider this all yee who take your ſelues to bee mighty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your neighbours; ye whom God hath bleſſed with this worlds good aboue your neighbours. Thinke not your wealth or authority can protect you, when Gods ſore diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhall breake out againſt you for your ſinnes: but rather let it euer be written in your hearts, what is written, <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 6.6.
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:1736:135"/> 
                     <hi>The mighty ſhall be mightily tormented.</hi> And remember what is added in that place: <hi>He that is Lord ouer all will ſpare no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, neither ſhall he feare any greatneſſe: for hee hath made the ſmall and the great, and careth for all alike. But for the mighty abideth the ſorer triall.</hi> And hence ariſeth a third vſe.</p>
                  <p>It is to miniſter a word of comfort to the inferiour and poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſort of people. If the mighty ſhall<note n="g" place="margin">

                        <hi>Eſa.</hi> 3.15.</note> grinde your faces; if by <hi>violence</hi> and <hi>oppreſſion</hi> they<note n="k" place="margin">
                        <hi>Habak.</hi> 1.4.</note> compaſſe you about; yet be ye of good comfort: God, the Iudge of all, accepteth no perſons. He in his good time will auenge your cauſes, be your oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors neuer ſo mighty; for <hi>when he puniſheth a land for the ſinnes of a people, he ſpareth neither Prieſt, nor Prince, nor King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a fourth vſe of this Doctrine. It is to warne vs not to ſet our hearts vpon the outward things of this world, for as much as God will not reſpect vs for them. Neither <hi>Prieſt,</hi> nor <hi>Prince,</hi> nor <hi>King</hi> can ſtand before the diſpleaſure of Almighty God. And ſhall a mighty man, ſhall a rich man ſtand? No.<note n="l" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.2.</note> 
                     <hi>As the ſmoke vaniſheth, ſo ſhall he be driuen away;</hi> and <hi>as the wax melteth before the fire; ſo ſhal he periſh at the preſence of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore (dearely beloued in the <hi>Lord</hi>) let vs onely and earneſtly ſeeke after ſuch things, as may make vs accepted with God, as <hi>righteouſneſſe, peace,</hi> and <hi>ioy in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer in theſe things ſerueth <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hee is <hi>acceptable to God,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 14.18. Thus farre by occaſion of my firſt doctrine: which was,
<q>When God puniſheth a nation with captiuity for their ſinnes, he ſpareth neither, prieſt, nor prince, nor king.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it was grounded vpon the firſt reading of the words of my text; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I commended vnto you another reading out of the Vulgar Latine: <hi>Melchom ſhall goe into captiuity, he, and his Princes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:</hi> and I told you in the beginning of this exerciſe what <hi>Melchom was.</hi> I ſaid it was the ſame with <hi>Milchom,</hi> or <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech,</hi>
                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:1736:135"/> or <hi>Moloch;</hi> an <hi>abomination</hi> of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> their <hi>Idoll,</hi> their <hi>God,</hi> to whom they yeelded <hi>diuine worſhip,</hi> and conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their children through fire. All this I made plaine vnto you out of the ſacred Scriptures. The Doctrine,
<q>Neither <hi>Melchom</hi> of the Ammonites, nor any other Idoll of any other people, can ſaue themſelues in the day of captiuity, much leſſe can they ſaue the people that doe truſt in them and worſhip them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>they cannot ſaue themſelues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>nor them that put their truſt in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They cannot ſaue themſelues.</hi> For what is become of <hi>Succoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benoth,</hi> the God of <hi>Babel?</hi> of <hi>Nergal,</hi> the God of <hi>Cuth?</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhima,</hi> the God of <hi>Hamath?</hi> of <hi>Nibhaz</hi> and <hi>Tartack,</hi> the God of the <hi>Auins?</hi> of <hi>Adrammelech,</hi> and <hi>Anammelech,</hi> the God of <hi>Sepharvaim?</hi> Their names indeed remaine vpon record, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.30, 31. but themſelues are vaniſhed, they are come to nought. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> he who brake in peeces the brazen Serpent which <hi>Moſes</hi> made, becauſe his people offered incenſe to it, he put downe thoſe Idoll Gods; he <hi>tooke away their high places,</hi> hee <hi>brake their images,</hi> hee <hi>cut downe their groues,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.4.</p>
                  <p>What is become of <hi>Aſhtoreth,</hi> the Idoll of the <hi>Zidonians?</hi> of <hi>Chemoſh,</hi> the Idoll of the <hi>Moabites?</hi> of <hi>Milchom</hi> the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the children of <hi>Ammon?</hi> Their names indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vpon record, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.13. but themſelues are vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, they are come to nought. <hi>Ioſiah</hi> King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> that good King, he put downe thoſe <hi>Idoll Gods,</hi> he <hi>brake their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in peeces,</hi> he <hi>cut downe their groues, and filled their places with the bones of men,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.14.</p>
                  <p>I could here repeat vnto you many other <hi>Idols</hi> and <hi>Idoll Gods,</hi> whoſe names are particularly recorded in the regiſter of Gods holy Word, which alſo are vaniſhed and come to nought. But the time will not ſuffer me. Let it ſuffice what is ſpoken in a generality of the Kings of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.18. that they did <hi>ſet on fire the Gods of the Nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gods?</hi> And yet <hi>ſet on fire?</hi> True. But they were but <hi>Idoll Gods;</hi> and therefore could not helpe themſelues. Not helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues?
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:1736:136"/> Why not? The reaſon is giuen in the ſame place: <hi>For they were no Gods,</hi> (an Idoll God is no God) <hi>they were no Gods, but the worke of mans hands, euen wood and ſtone:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the Kings of Aſſyria deſtroyed them.</hi> The very ſame reaſon is deliuered in the very ſame words by the Prophet <hi>Eſay, Chap.</hi> 37.19. <hi>They were no Gods, but the worke of mens hands, euen wood and ſtone, therefore the Kings of Aſſyria de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The holy Prophets are very zealous in Gods cauſe againſt thoſe Idols. <hi>Eſay Chap.</hi> 41.29. ſaith, <hi>They are all vanity, their worke is of nothing, they are wind, they are confuſion. Ier. Chap.</hi> 10.15. ſaith, <hi>They are vanity, they are the worke of errors: in the time of their viſitation they ſhall periſh.</hi> I ſhould weary my ſelfe, and your attention, would I produce whatſoeuer the Prophets of the <hi>Lord</hi> haue ſpoken to the vilifying &amp; debaſing of <hi>Idols.</hi> This which I haue already deliuered out of <hi>Eſay,</hi> and <hi>Ieremy,</hi> and from out <hi>the ſecond booke of Kings,</hi> doth make good the former part of my propounded Doctrine, namely, that <hi>neither</hi> Melchom <hi>of the Ammonites, nor any other Idoll of any other people can ſaue themſelues in the day of captiuity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Can they not ſaue themſelues in the day of captiuity?</hi> Much leſſe <hi>can they ſaue the people that doe truſt in them and worſhip them;</hi> which was the ſecond part of my Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>And it is pregnantly confirmed out of the 46. Chapter of the Prophecy of <hi>Eſay, verſ.</hi> 7. where the Prophet, out of his zeale for the <hi>Lord</hi> of Hoſts againſt <hi>Idols</hi> and <hi>Images,</hi> aſſureth all people, that <hi>though they cry vnto Idols and Images, yet can they not anſwer them, nor deliuer them out of their tribulations. Ieremy</hi> likewiſe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.12. lets the Cities of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and the inhabitants of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to vnderſtand, that <hi>though they cry vnto their Idols and Images, yet they ſhall not be able to helpe them in time of their trouble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Adde hereto what <hi>S. Auſtine</hi> ſaith in his <hi>ſoliloquies,</hi> or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly meditations, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>An Idoll</hi> (or an Image) <hi>its</hi>

<q>Neither <hi>Melchom</hi> of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> nor any other Idoll of any other people can ſaue themſelues in the day of captiuity, much leſſe can they ſaue the people that doe truſt in them and worſhip them.</q>

                  <p>May not now a godly man iuſtly for zealous indignation cry out: O heauen, O earth, O ſeas; what madneſſe and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe againſt God were our fore-fathers fallen into? They tooke delight in the ſeruice of <hi>ſtocks</hi> and <hi>ſtones,</hi> the workes of their owne hands, they worſhipped and ſerued the <hi>creature</hi> aboue the <hi>Creator,</hi> which is bleſſed for euer.</p>
                  <p>But what profit had they of ſuch their worſhip? Found they any helpe in the day of viſitation? No: Thoſe Images them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues could not helpe themſelues; and how then could they helpe their worſhippers? Themſelues were broken downe and remoued from out our <hi>Churches;</hi> and their worſhippers are remoued with them. In their ſtead the light of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Goſpell of God now ſhineth in our <hi>Churches;</hi> now is <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition</hi> exiled, and the <hi>true ſeruice of God</hi> is come in place: and <hi>Chriſt</hi> for his mercies ſake touch vs, and giue vs feeling, and make vs thankfull for this ſo great a bleſſing. Thus haue you the firſt vſe. A ſecond followeth.</p>
                  <p>It ſerueth for a reproofe to vs alſo. For though we haue caſt off the yoke of Romiſh <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> and haue kept our ſelues vnſpotted of the <hi>adoration</hi> and <hi>worſhip of Images,</hi> yet are wee not free from <hi>Idolatry;</hi> but are many waies ſtained therewith. Whatſoeuer this world hath, viſible or inuiſible, outward or inward, if it diſplace <hi>God</hi> of his right, by carrying our heart and hope after it, it is our <hi>Idoll.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus is <hi>gold, ſiluer,</hi> or <hi>our money</hi> an <hi>Idoll;</hi> if we <hi>make it our hope,</hi> or <hi>ſay to the wedge, thou art my confidence, Iob</hi> 31.24. In this ſenſe <hi>S. Paul. Coloſſ.</hi> 3.5. calleth <hi>couetouſneſſe, Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5. he calleth <hi>the couetous perſon an Idolater.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus is our <hi>ſubſtance</hi> an <hi>Idoll:</hi> if as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Chap.</hi> 31.25. <hi>We reioyce, becauſe it is great, or becauſe our hand hath gotten much.</hi> Like thoſe <hi>Habak.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Who did ſacrifice to their nets, and burne Incenſe to their flues:</hi> where all they are taxed for <hi>Idolaters,</hi> who becauſe their portion is increaſed, and their meale plenteous by ſuch <hi>inſtruments</hi> and <hi>helps,</hi> as they vſe in their trades of life, doe forget the right <hi>author</hi> of their wealth, and arrogate all to themſelues and their ſeruiceable meanes.</p>
                  <p>Thus is our <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>vnderſtanding</hi> an <hi>Idoll,</hi> when we aſcribe
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:1736:137"/> vnto them our getting of riches, of gold, and ſiluer into our treaſures, like the Prince of <hi>Tyrus, Ezech.</hi> 28.2. who with this conceit exalted in heart, brake out into that moſt blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous challenge: <hi>I am a God, and I ſit in the ſeat of God in the middeſt of the Sea.</hi> Such is the <hi>Idoll</hi> of the <hi>Polititians</hi> (ſhall I call them? or Atheiſts) of this age: who take themſelues to be wiſer than <hi>Daniel,</hi> as the Prince of <hi>Tyrus</hi> did: and are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets are not ſo able to inſtruct them, as they themſelues.</p>
                  <p>Thus is our <hi>ſtrength</hi> an <hi>Idoll,</hi> if we boaſt of it, as <hi>Sennacherib</hi> did, <hi>Eſay</hi> 37.24. who bragged what great matters hee had done <hi>by the multitude of his chariots;</hi> but touching the true <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> as if he were leſſe than nothing, he vaunteth to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> verſ. 10. <hi>Let not thy God deceiue thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus is our <hi>belly</hi> our <hi>God,</hi> when walking after the luſts of our fleſh, we <hi>ſerue not the Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>our owne bellies:</hi> as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.18. Of ſuch ſpeaketh the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Many doe walke as enemies to the croſſe of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>whoſe end is damnation, whoſe God is their belly, whoſe glory is their ſhame, who mind earthly things.</hi> Whoſe God is their <hi>belly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus (beloued) you ſee what <hi>Idols</hi> are yet remaining among vs, and how we are defiled with them. What remaineth, but that we ſuffer our ſelues to be exhorted in the words of <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> to the men of <hi>Lyſtra, Act.</hi> 14.15. that we would turne <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus farre of my ſecond Doctrine, which was,
<q>Neither <hi>Melchom</hi> of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> nor any other Idoll of any other people can ſaue themſelues in the day of captiuity, much leſſe can they ſaue the people that doe truſt in them, and worſhip them.</q>

                  <p>Which doctrine I grounded vpon the ſecond reading of my Text: <hi>Melchom ſhall goe into captiuity, he, and his Princes together.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>This is the concluſion of this Prophecie; and it redoubleth
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:1736:138"/> its authority and credit. Authority and credit ſufficient it hath from its very front, and preface, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord.</hi> It is here redoubled: <hi>Saith the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hath the <hi>Lord</hi> ſaid it, and ſhall he not doe it? Hath he ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, and ſhall he not accompliſh it? The <hi>Lord, Iehouah,</hi> the ſtrength of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is not as man, that he ſhould lie; nor as the ſonne of man, that he ſhould repent. All his <hi>words,</hi> yea all the <hi>tittles of all his words,</hi> are <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi> Heauen and earth ſhal paſſe, before one iot, or one tittle of Gods Word ſhall ſcape vnfulfilled. <hi>Iehouah,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> ſaith, whatſoeuer our Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> hath here denounced againſt the <hi>Ammonites.</hi> It is the <hi>Lord</hi> that ſaith it: <hi>Amos</hi> is but the <hi>Lords</hi> Miniſter; the Words are the <hi>Lords.</hi> Whence we may take this Doctrine;
<q>The Author of holy Scripture is neither man, nor Angell, nor any otber creature, how excellent ſoeuer, but only the liuing and immortall God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This truth may likewiſe be grounded vpon the Preface to the enſuing Prophecy: And therefore (ſith my houre is almoſt ſpent, and your attention well nigh tired) I put off the handling of this doctrine, till God giue me opportunity to ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vnto you.

The <hi>Syrians,</hi> the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> and the <hi>Ammonites</hi> haue for their ſinnes bin ſeuerally repayed with vengeance from Heauen; the fire of the wrath of God hath ſeized vpon them, and deuoured them; their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1736:141"/> Cities are become deſolate; their memorie is periſhed from off the earth. As it is befallen them, ſo it befalleth the <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi> alſo: againſt whom <hi>Amos</hi> in the beginning of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter directeth his prophecie: and to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, whereto the prophecies of the former Chapter were directed.</p>
                  <p>The<note n="a" place="margin">See my ſixth Lecture vpon Amos 1.</note> reaſons why <hi>Amos,</hi> ſent of purpoſe with a meſſage to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> doth firſt prophecie againſt the <hi>Syrians,</hi> the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> the <hi>Edomites,</hi> the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and the <hi>Moabites,</hi> all forreine nations, are three.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he might be the more patiently heard of his countrymen, the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſeeing their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Amos</hi> ſo ſharpe againſt the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and other their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, could not but with more quiet heare him, when he ſhould prophecie againſt them alſo. <hi>Conſolatio quaedam est afflictio inimici:</hi> Some comfort it is to a diſtreſſed naturall man, to ſee his enemie in diſtreſſe likewiſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they might haue no cauſe to wonder, if God ſhould at any time come againſt them in vengeance, ſeeing that he would not ſpare the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and other their neighbor countries, though they were deſtitute of the light of Gods word, and ignorant of his will.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That they might the more tremble at the words of this prophecie, when they ſhould ſee the <hi>Syrians</hi> and other Nations affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Here might the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> thus haue argued: Will not God ſpare the <hi>Syrians,</hi> the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> the <hi>Moabites?</hi> Then out of doubt he will not ſpare vs. They ſilly people neuer knew the holy will of God, and yet ſhall they be ſo ſeuerely puniſhed? How then ſhall we eſcape; who knowing Gods holy will, haue contemned it?</p>
                  <p>You ſee now, why <hi>Amos</hi> ſent with a meſſage to the Ten Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> doth firſt prophecie againſt foreine Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1736:141"/> of the <hi>Bible,</hi> do add to the firſt Chapter, as a part of it. But ſith the <hi>Hebrew</hi> text ſo diuides it not, I will not follow them: but will expound it, as belonging to the ſecond Chapter.</p>
                  <p>The words then which I haue read vnto you, are the burden of <hi>Moab;</hi> a heauy prophecie againſt <hi>Moab.</hi> And doe conteine three generall parts.</p>

                  <p>Thus haue you the Analyſis, reſolution, or diuiſion of my Text. Returne we now to the Preface: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord;</hi> whoſe name in my Text is <hi>Iehovah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sundry are the <hi>Names</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in holy Scripture; by which albeit the <hi>ſubſtance of God</hi> cannot aptly, and clearely be defined, yet they ſerue vs thus farre; to bring vs to ſome further knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> then otherwiſe we ſhould haue. Theſe Names of <hi>God</hi> are obſerued by ancient Diuines to be of two ſorts, Negatiue, and Affirmatiue.</p>
                  <p>The negatiue Names of <hi>God,</hi> are <hi>Vncreated, Incorporeall, Inviſible, Incorruptible, Infinite,</hi> and ſuch like: and theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe not, what <hi>God</hi> is; but what he is not; and doe eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declare vnto vs, that he is <hi>bonum quoddam excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimum,</hi> ſome moſt excellent <hi>Good,</hi> free from all imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of any creature.</p>
                  <p>The affirmatiue Names of <hi>God,</hi> are aſcribed vnto him either eſſentially, or by way of relation, or by a Metaphor. The Names of <hi>God</hi> aſcribed vnto him eſſentially, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proper to him alone, or common to others alſo. Among the eſſentiall Names of <hi>God,</hi> proper to him alone, is <hi>Iehovah,</hi> the Name of <hi>God</hi> in my Text. His other eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall Names communicable vnto others, as to men, doe yet belong vnto <hi>God,</hi> either <hi>modo excellentiae,</hi> by an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie: or <hi>modo cauſa independentis;</hi> as he is the primarie cauſe of all things. By an excellencie, <hi>God</hi> is ſaid to bee <hi>Good, Iuſt, Wiſe, Mighty, Holy, Mercifull:</hi> and as he is the primarie cauſe of all things, ſo is he called a <hi>Creator,</hi> a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi> and hath other like appellations.</p>
                  <p>Now the affirmatiue Names of <hi>God,</hi> aſcribed vnto him by way of relation, are the Names of the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> in which there is no <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meation, no vnion; each perſon hath his proper name. <hi>Father, Son,</hi> &amp; <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The other affirmatiue Names of God aſcribed vnto him by a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, are affirmed of him either <hi>per</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1736:142"/> euery man may vnderſtand what they meane: as when <hi>God</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>Angrie;</hi> or <hi>per</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, by analogie or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, as when <hi>God</hi> is called a <hi>Lyon,</hi> a <hi>Stone,</hi> a <hi>Riuer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of theſe many Names of <hi>God,</hi> now repeated vnto you, his moſt proper Name is his Name in my Text: his Name <hi>Iehouah,</hi> a Name that cannot be attributed to any creature in the world, no not by an analogie, or ſimilitude. It is the honourableſt Name belonging to the great God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. I might ſpend much time about it, would I apply my ſelfe to the curioſity of the<note n="b" place="margin">See my third Lecture vpon Amos 1.</note>

But theſe their braine-ſicke, ſuperſtitious, and blaſphemous inventions, my tongue ſhall not enlarge. Yet thus much I ſay of this Name, that there is a ſecret in it. It is plaine <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.3. There thus ſaith the <hi>Lord</hi> vnto <hi>Moſes: I appeared vnto Abraham, to Iſaac, and to Iacob, by the name of a ſtrong, omnipotent, and all-ſufficient God, but by my name IEHOVAH was I not knowne to them.</hi> This ſecret I haue heretofore vnfolded vnto you after this manner.</p>
                  <p>This great name of <hi>God,</hi> this name <hi>Iehovah;</hi> firſt it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth the eternitie of Gods eſſence in himſelfe, that he is <hi>yeſterday,</hi> and <hi>to day,</hi> and <hi>the ſame for euer; which was, which is,</hi> and <hi>which is to come.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is the <hi>Memoriall</hi> of God vnto all ages, as himſelfe calls it. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.15. The <hi>Memoriall</hi> of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, his truth, and his conſtancie in the performance of his promiſes. And therefore whenſoeuer in any of the Prophets God promiſeth, or threatneth, any great matter, to aſſure vs of the moſt certaine euent of ſuch his promiſe, or threatning, he adds vnto it his name <hi>Iehovah:</hi> as here in my text: <hi>Thus ſaith Iehovah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iehovah.]</hi> The ſtrength of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> who is not as man, that he ſhould lye, nor as the ſonne of man that he ſhould repent. Wicked <hi>Balaam</hi> is driuen to confeſſe as much, <hi>Num.</hi> 23.19. and there proceedeth by way of queſtion: <hi>Hath the Lord ſaid, and ſhall he not doe it? Hath he ſpoken and ſhall he not accompliſh it? Samuel</hi> with boldnes tells <hi>Saul,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.29. that the <hi>Lord,</hi> who is <hi>the ſtrength of Iſrael will not lye nor repent;</hi> and he giues this reaſon of it: <hi>For he is not a man that he ſhould repent.</hi> All his words, yea all the titles of all his words are <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen,</hi> ſo firmely ratified, that they cannot be altered; ſo ſtanding immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that they cannot be changed. Our Sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> giues record herevnto. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.35. <hi>Coelum &amp; terra prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teribunt.</hi> Heauen and Earth ſhall paſſe away; but Gods words, they ſhall not paſſe away. The graſſe withereth, ſaith the Prophet <hi>Eſay cap.</hi> 40.8. <hi>The graſſe withereth, and the flower fadeth, but the word of our God ſhall ſtand for euer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus are we by this name <hi>Iehovah</hi> led to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the truth of God. Gods <hi>truth</hi> is his eſſentiall proprietie, whereby he is moſt free from all ſhew or ſhadow of falſhood. This his truth is eminent <hi>in himſelfe,</hi> in <hi>his workes,</hi> and <hi>in his words. In himſelfe,</hi> two manner of wayes. 1. In reſpect of his eſſence, whereby he truly is. 2. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as he is the Idea, type, and patterne of all the <hi>truth</hi> that is in any creature.</p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1736:143"/>
                  <p>Now concerning the workes of God, they all are <hi>Truth?</hi> whether they be <hi>Internall,</hi> or <hi>Externall.</hi> His <hi>Internall workes</hi> are either <hi>perſonall,</hi> or <hi>eſſentiall:</hi> and both nothing but <hi>truth.</hi> For his perſonall workes: the <hi>Father</hi> doth <hi>truly beget</hi> the <hi>Sonne,</hi> the <hi>Sonne</hi> is <hi>truly begotten</hi> of the <hi>Father:</hi> and the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> doth <hi>truly proceed</hi> from the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Sonne:</hi> the like muſt we ſay of his <hi>eſſentiall workes;</hi> Whatſoeuer God hath decreed, he hath <hi>truly</hi> decreed it, and doth <hi>truly</hi> exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe <hi>Internall workes</hi> of God, ſome <hi>workes</hi> of his are called in the Schooles <hi>Externall.</hi> Such are the creation of the world, the conſeruation of the ſame, the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, the couenant with the faithfull, and the like, in all which, moſt conſtant is the <hi>truth</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p>As the <hi>truth</hi> of God is eminent <hi>in himſelfe,</hi> and <hi>in his workes,</hi> ſo alſo is it eminent <hi>in his words.</hi> This hath but now, bin prooued vnto you by the confeſſion of <hi>Balaam,</hi> by the aſſeueration of <hi>Samuel,</hi> by the record of the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> and of our Sauiour <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> I ſhut vp this doctrine of the <hi>truth</hi> of God, with the words of the bleſſed Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Let God be true, and euery man a lyar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now let vs ſee what vſes may be made of this doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Is it true?</p>
                  <p>Is God <hi>truth</hi> in himſelfe, in his works and in his words?</p>
                  <p>Hereby may euery childe of God among vs be well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that our faith in God the <hi>Father,</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> his <hi>Sonne,</hi> and in the holy <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> proceeding from the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Sonne,</hi> is moſt true and moſt certaine: and cannot by any meanes be deceiued it ſelfe, or deceiue vs? For it is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſupported, vpon, and by the words of him, who onely is the <hi>true</hi> God, yea <hi>truth</hi> it ſelfe: who hath <hi>truly</hi> ſayd concerning vs, and all other, who beleeue in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he hath<note n="c" place="margin">

                  <p>Which being ſo, what remaineth on our parts, but that we abide conſtantly in our holy faith, and perſeuere there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, euen vnto the end? Without perſeuerance our faith will not auaile vs. For not euery one, but ſuch onely as are <hi>marked in their foreheads</hi> with the letter <hi>Tau,</hi> with the note of perfection, and perſeuerance, ſhall enter the inheritance of the bleſſed. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 9 4. And not euery one, but <hi>he</hi> onely, that <hi>endureth to the end ſhall be ſaued.</hi> Matth. 10.22. And not euery one, but he onely which is <hi>faithfull vnto death,</hi> ſhall receiue the <hi>crowne of life.</hi> Reuel. 2.10.</p>
                  <p>Let the <hi>dog returne to his vomit,</hi> and the <hi>waſhed ſow to her wallowing in the mire,</hi> as the Prouerbs are. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. But let vs hold faſt our holy faith, till it ſhall pleaſe God to call vs to make our finall account, how we haue ſpent the dayes of our Pilgrimage in this preſent world. So ſhall he, that is holy, and true; who hath<note n="i" place="margin">

                  <p>Thus haue you the firſt vſe of my firſt doctrine, touching the truth of God. My doctrine was:
<q>God is truth in himſelfe, in his workes, and in his words.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt vſe concerneth our faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance therein. A ſecond followeth.</p>
                  <p>It appertaineth to thankeſgiuing. For if our ſaluation, and eternall life doe depend vpon the knowledge of the heauenly <hi>truth;</hi> and God brings none to the knowledge of this <hi>truth</hi> but his elect, and choſen people; how great thankes ought we to giue vnto God, not onely for choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vs, but alſo for making it knowne vnto vs by the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his <hi>truth,</hi> that we are his choſen people. For he hath not onely imprinted in the vs image of that <hi>truth,</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:1736:144"/> which is eternall in himſelfe; but alſo daily bringeth vs to ſuch a meaſure of knowledge of that his heauenly <hi>truth</hi> wherein conſiſteth our ſaluation, that we may be ſaued.</p>
                  <p>What greater benefit can there be vnto vs, then this? What more ample teſtimonie of his eternall good will to vs? For this benefit, that is, for the knowledge of Gods heauenly <hi>truth,</hi> the bleſſed Apoſtle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> neuer ceaſed to giue thanks vnto God. I thanke God (ſaith he 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12.) I <hi>thanke him, who hath made me ſtrong, that is, Chriſt Ieſus our Lord: for he counted me faithfull, and put me in his ſeruice;</hi> When <hi>before I was a blaſphemer, and a perſecutor, and an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor, but I was receiued to mercy.</hi> From this his thankefull heart proceeded thoſe his words, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. Doubtleſſe, <hi>I thinke all things but loſſe, for the excellent knowledge ſake of Chriſt Ieſus my Lord, for whom I haue counted all things loſſe, and doe iudge them to be but</hi>

                     </gap>, euen <hi>dung, that I might winne Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Pauls</hi> charitie was not confined within the Temple of his owne bodie; others had a taſt thereof. As the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> to whom in his firſt Epiſtle, cap. 1. ver. 4. he thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſteth his affection: <hi>I thanke my God alwayes on your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, for the grace of God which is giuen you in Ieſus Chriſt, that in all things ye are made rich in him, in all kind of ſpeech. And in all knowledge.</hi> I thanke my God alwayes on your behalfe, not for your riches, for your honors, for your large poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, for your flouriſhing cittie, but for the grace of God, which is giuen you in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> for your free vocation, for your faith, for your reconciliation, for your iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for your regeneration, for your hope of eternall ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the preaching of the word of God among you, and for your knowledge of the truth thereof.</p>
                  <p>The knowledge of this truth of God, farre ſurpaſſeth all the treaſures of this corruptible world. Shall not we then poure out our ſoules in thankfulnes before almightie God, for beſtowing vpon vs ſo gracious a bleſſing, as is <hi>this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth of God?</hi> Let vs with the ſpirit of bleſſed <hi>Paul,</hi> account all things which haue beene, or are gainefull
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1736:145"/> to vs in this preſent world, to be but loſſe and dung in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of <hi>this knowledge of Gods holy truth,</hi> foraſmuch as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may winne <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Thus haue you the ſecond vſe of my doctrine. My doctrine was:
<q>God is truth in himſelfe, in his workes, and in his words.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond vſe concerneth our thankeſgiuing for <hi>the knowledge of Gods truth.</hi> The third tendeth to our imitation.</p>
                  <p>Is it true? Is God <hi>truth in himſelfe, in his workes, and in his words?</hi> Why ſtriue we not with all the faculties, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of our ſoules to repreſent our God in <hi>truth?</hi> He in the beginning, in the firſt man, in our forefather <hi>Adam,</hi> created and made vs in his owne image, after his owne likeneſſe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. Then was man inueſted with glorious roabes, with immortalitie, with vnderſtanding, with freedome of will; then was he perfectly good, and chaſt, and pure, and iuſt, and true: Whatſoeuer might appertaine to happines, or holineſſe, he then had it. For God created him ſo like vnto himſelfe in perfect happines, and holineſſe; that he might in ſome ſort beare about with him the image of the great and glorious <hi>God</hi> of Heauen.</p>
                  <p>But alas, our firſt Parent continued not long in that his firſt eſtate, of puritie, innocencie, and integritie; by his fall he loſt vs, that his precious Iewell, which, (had he ſtood faſt) would haue beene vnto vs a chaine of gold about our neckes; yea, as it is called <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.5. <hi>A crowne of honor, and glorie.</hi> But by his fall we are become miſerable, and vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and wicked, and vncleane, and falſe; as vnlike to God, as <hi>darkeneſſe</hi> is to <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> is to <hi>Heauen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this eſtate of ſinne, and death, we all lay wallowing, till God of his owne vnſpeakeable mercy, and goodneſſe raiſed vs vp by his grace to a better ſtate; a ſtate of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſaluation; wherein all we whoſe names are written in the Regiſter of the elect, and choſen children of <hi>God,</hi> muſt ſpend the remainder and reſidue of the dayes of our pilgrimage in this world. In this ſtate wee muſt not ſtand at one ſtay, but muſt alwayes be growing vpward. We muſt day by day endeuour to encreaſe our ſpirituall
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1736:145"/> ſtrength, and change our Chriſtian infancie with a ripe and conſtant age; and adde grace to grace, till we become per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect men in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To vs, now in the ſtate of regeneration belongeth the exhortation of God vnto the children of <hi>Iſraell.</hi> Leuit. 11.44. <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy:</hi> And that of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to his audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors vpon the Mount. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.48. <hi>Be ye perfect, as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heauen is perfect:</hi> or as it is in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> Chap. 6.36. <hi>Be ye mercifull, as your Father alſo is merciful.</hi> By which places we are not exhorted to a perfection of ſupererogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as <hi>Monkes</hi> would haue it, nor to a perfect and abſolute fulfilling of the Law; for that is impoſſible, ſo long as wee carry about vs theſe veſſels of corruption: witneſſe S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 8.3. But all that we are exhorted to, is, that we would do our beſt endeuours to reſemble our God, and to be like vnto him, in holineſſe, in perfection, in mercifulneſſe. <hi>Be holy, as God is holy: be perfect, as God is perfect; be mercifull, as God is mercifull; non abſoluta aequalitate, ſed ſimilitudine:</hi> not abſolutely, and equally, <hi>holy, perfect,</hi> and <hi>mercifull,</hi> as God is, but by a ſimilitude. God is our <hi>Father:</hi> and will not we his children, like good children, ſtriue to be acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated and fitted to our <hi>Fathers</hi> vertues?</p>
                  <p>Beloued, let vs apply our ſelues to this imitation of our heauenly <hi>Father,</hi> to be <hi>holy,</hi> as <hi>he is holy;</hi> to be <hi>perfect,</hi> as <hi>he is perfect;</hi> to be <hi>mercifull,</hi> as <hi>he is mercifull;</hi> and for my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe, <hi>to be true,</hi> as <hi>he is true.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this laſt we may thus be led. God is our Creator; and he is the <hi>God of truth.</hi> Pſal. 31.5. Chriſt is our Redeemer, and <hi>he is Truth. Ioh.</hi> 14.6. We are renued by the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> and he is the <hi>ſpirit of Truth. Ioh.</hi> 16.13. We liue in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the Church; and ſhe is the <hi>pillar and ground of Truth</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. Thus liuing, we are <hi>taught by the word of truth. Coloſ.</hi> 1.5. And are brought to <hi>the knowledge of the Truth.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. And are <hi>ſanctified by Truth. Ioh.</hi> 17.17. Adde hereto, that we are commaunded euery one to <hi>ſpeake the Truth, Epheſ.</hi> 4.25. And ſhall we doe our beſt to reſemble God <hi>in Truth?</hi> To be <hi>true</hi> as he is <hi>true?</hi> Dearely beloued,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1736:146"/> ſith we are the children of <hi>Truth</hi> (for <hi>God is Truth,</hi> and his children we are) let vs walke, as it becometh the <hi>children of Truth:</hi> let <hi>Truth</hi> be in our thoughts, in our words, in our workes: in all our wayes.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall I more ſay to this poynt, but exhort you in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paules</hi> words, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.25. That ye would caſt off lying, and ſpeake euery man the <hi>truth</hi> to his neighbour. For as much as the <hi>Lord will deſtroy all ſuch as ſpeake lies.</hi> This you know by the fift <hi>Pſalme,</hi> ver. the 6. But how will he deſtroy them? It is anſwered. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 21.8. <hi>All lyars ſhall haue their part in the lake, which burneth with fire and brimſtone.</hi> Thus haue you the third vſe of my doctrine. My doctrine was:
<q>God is truth in himſelfe, in his workes, and in his words.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third vſe is, our holy imitation of God in <hi>truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is yet a fourth vſe of this doctrine of the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> It ſerues for a redargution, or reproofe of ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>truth.</hi> Deny <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>truth?</hi> Can there be any, endued with a reaſonable ſoule, ſo voyd of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding? Yes. There is a generation of men monſtrouſly miſhapen in the powers of the ſoule, who ſpare not to break the cords of Religion aſunder, and to caſt her yoke from them. They dare auouch with thoſe in <hi>Tullie, Totam de Dijs immortalibus opinionem fictam eſſe ab hominibus ſapienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus reipub. cauſâ, vt quos ratio non poſſet, eos ad officium religio duceret:</hi> judging the ſeruice of God to be a meere deuiſe of man, for the better gouernment of the Common-wealth; wherein inferiors, ſith they will not be ruled by <hi>reaſon,</hi> muſt be ordered by <hi>religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tell ſuch of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> you may as well vrge them with <hi>Lucians</hi> narrations: tell them of <hi>repentance,</hi> they caſt it behind them: tell them of <hi>faith,</hi> they regard it not. Speake to them of <hi>baptiſme,</hi> they hold it of no greater price, then the waſhing of their hands. Let them heare of the <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> this feeds them with many a merry conceit. They thinke pleaſantly with themſelues, what manner of bodies they ſhall haue at that day, of what proportion and ſtature their bodies ſhall be; whether their nayles, and haire ſhall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1736:146"/> riſe againe. Impious wretches, thus they make a ſcoffe at <hi>God</hi> and <hi>religion:</hi> whom, were they vſed according to their deſerts, the Preachers ſhould pronounce, and the Prince proclaime the fouleſt leapers, that euer yet ſore ranne vpon; very worthy to bee excluded the hoaſt, and to haue their habitation alone: yea to be exiled the land, and to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled from nature it ſelfe, which ſo vnnaturally they ſtriue to bring to naught. I ſay no more againſt them; but leaue them to the <hi>God of truth,</hi> whom they haue denied, that he in due time may repay them home with vengeance.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre am I guided by my firſt doctrine, grounded vpon this eſſentiall name of <hi>God,</hi> his name <hi>Iehouah:</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting his <hi>truth</hi> in himſelfe, in his workes, and in his words: <hi>Thus ſaith Iehouah.</hi>

Sweet then is the harmony, conſent and agreement of all the Prophets, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſts, and Apoſtles, from the firſt vnto the laſt. Not one of them ſpake one word of a naturall man, in all their miniſteries: the words which they ſpake, were the words of him that ſent them: they ſpake not of themſelues; God ſpake in them. Whenſoeuer were the time, whatſoeuer were the meanes, whoſoeuer were the man, whereſoeuer were the place, whatſoeuer were the people, the words were the Lords. Hence ariſeth this doctrine:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Author of holy Scripture is neither man nor Angell, nor any other creature, how excellent ſoeuer, but onely the liuing and immortall God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This truth is euident, by this which I haue but now deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For if <hi>God</hi> in old time ſpake to our <hi>Fathers,</hi> by the mouth of <hi>Moſes,</hi> if <hi>God</hi> ſpake by other his Prophets, if <hi>God</hi> ſpake by the Euangeliſts and Apoſtles, if all Scripture be inſpired of God; then it well followeth; that <hi>God is the author of Scripture:</hi> and therefore not <hi>man,</hi> nor <hi>Angell, nor any other creature, how excellent ſoeuer.</hi> I can but point at the vſes of this doctrine.</p>
                  <p>The firſt vſe is redargution.

Wee may not ſpeake either the imagination of our owne braines, or the vaine perſwaſions of our own hearts. We muſt ſincerely preach vnto you, Gods gracious word without all corruption, or deprauing of the ſame. To this S <hi>Peter</hi> well exhorteth vs in his 1.

                  <p>The third vſe of this doctrine, is peculiar vnto you (Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued) who are auditors and hearers of the word. Is <hi>the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and immortall God the author of holy Scripture?</hi> Then (Beloued) it is your part to heare vs with attention, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, whenſoeuer wee ſtand before you, to expound Gods holy Scripture. S. <hi>Paul</hi> commendeth the <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> Epiſt. 1. chap. 2.13. For that whenſoeuer <hi>they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of the Apoſtles of Chriſt, the word of the preaching of God, they receiued it not as the word of men, but as it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, the word of God.</hi> In like ſort, if you receiue it, it will <hi>ſaue your ſoules.</hi> It is <hi>able ſo to doe.</hi> S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſhall bee your pledge, chap. 1.21. Receiue it therefore with meekneſſe, that by it your ſoules may liue.</p>
                  <p>God ſpake vnto <hi>Iſrael</hi> in a viſion by night, and ſayd <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.2. <hi>Iaacob, Iaacob. Iaacob</hi> anſwered, I am heere. He was preſt and ready with all reuerent attention, to heare what his God would ſay vnto him, and to follow the ſame with all faithfull obedience. Such readineſſe well becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth euery childe of God at this day in the Church, where God ſpeaketh. Thus muſt hee thinke within himſelfe. It is thine ordinance, ô <hi>Lord,</hi> by thy word preached to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct me, concerning thy holy will. I am heere, <hi>Lord,</hi> in all humble feare, to heare thy bleſſed pleaſure, what this day thou wilt put into the mouth of the Preacher to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto me, I am heere, ſpeake on, <hi>Lord,</hi> thy ſeruant hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. If a Prince of this world, or ſome great man ſhall ſpeake vnto you, you will attend, and giue eare vnto him with all diligence; how much more then ought yee ſo to doe, when the King of Heauen, and Lord of the Earth, the liuing and immortall God, calleth vpon you by his Miniſters?</p>
                  <p>What remaineth but that you ſuffer a word of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. It ſhall bee ſhort: in <hi>S. Pauls</hi> words, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.16. Holy and beloued, as the elect of God, <hi>let the word of God dwell plenteouſly in you in all wiſdome.</hi> This word of God, it is his moſt royall and celeſtiall Teſtament, it is the oracle of his heauenly Sanctuarie, it is the only key vnto

                  <p>Let this word of God dwell plenteouſly in you in all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. So ſhall your wayes by it be clenſed, and your ſelues made cleane.

In which reſpect, they were for euer by God his ſingular command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment excluded from the Church. Gods commandement

                  <p>Now what are they accuſed of? Of many breaches of Gods law: in theſe words, <hi>For three, and foure tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions]</hi> This phraſe we met with fiue times in the former chapter, and haue heard it diuerſly expounded. The moſt naturall, proper and ſignificant expoſition commended to you was; by three, and foure, a finite, and certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to vnderſtand many; a number infinite, &amp; vncertaine. <hi>For three tranſgreſſions of Moab, and for foure,</hi> that is, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tranſgreſſions of the <hi>Moabites.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Here may you recall to your remembrances a doctrine ſundry times recommended to your religious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Many ſinnes doe plucke downe from Heauen the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine wrath and vengeance of God vpon the ſinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God is of pure eyes and beholdeth not iniquitie. He hath laid righteouſnes to the rule, and weighed his iuſtice in a ballance. His ſentence is paſſed forth from him, and ſtands vnalterable: <hi>Tribulation and anguiſh vpon euery ſoule that doth euill.</hi> The ſoule that ſinneth, it ſhall be puniſhed. God makes it good by an oath <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.41. <hi>That he will whet his glittring ſword, and his hand ſhall take hold on iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to execute vengeance for ſinne.</hi> His ſoule hateth, and abhorreth ſinne; his law curſeth, and condemneth ſinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his hand ſmiteth, and ſcourgeth ſinne. Sinne was his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1736:150"/> to caſt downe Angels into Hell, to thruſt <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe, to turne Cities into aſhes, to ruinate Nations, to torment his owne bowels in the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh. Becauſe of ſinne he once drowned the old world, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſinne ere long will burne this. Thus doe many ſinnes plucke downe &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>One vſe of this doctrine, is; to teach vs heedfulneſſe in all our wayes, that we doe not by our many ſinnes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke Almighty God to high diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Vſe, is; to moue vs to a ſerious contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wonderfull patience of Almighty God, who did ſo graciouſly forbeare theſe <hi>Moabites,</hi> till by their three, and foure tranſgreſſions, by their many ſinnes they had prouoked him to indignation. Theſe things I haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore laboured to lay vnto your hearts.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore I proceed to the third part of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie: wherein you haue the declaration of that grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſinne, by which the <hi>Moabites</hi> ſo highly offended. This their ſinne was a ſinne of <hi>cruelty;</hi> expreſſed in theſe words: <hi>Becauſe it burnt the bones of the King of Ed m into lime.</hi>

                  <p>Thus farre by occaſion of the firſt part of my propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which was, <hi>All kind of crueltie, committed againſt a man, highly diſpleaſeth God.</hi> You remember the reaſon of it: the reaſon is; <hi>Becauſe it is againſt the ſixt Commandement.</hi> The vſe of it, was a reproofe of ſuch as delight in <hi>crueltie,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the liuing, or the dead. Now followeth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of my propoſition: this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That crueltie which violateth, or extinguiſheth the rites of conſanguinitie, and naturall affection, ſpecially diſpleaſeth God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:1736:154"/>
                  <p>For God, the God of nature, cannot in any wiſe like, that natures lawes be violated. By natures lawes, its enacted, that there ſhould be, that ſame <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, much ſpoken of in the Schooles; a peculiar affection of loue from the parent to the childe, and from the childe to the parent; from a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a brother, from a kinſman to a kinſman. Now if <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie</hi> ſhall be exerciſed from a parent towards his childe, or from a child towards his parent, or from a brother towards his brother, or from a kinſman towards his kinſman, that ſame <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, I ſpak of, is laid aſide; the rites of conſanguinity, and naturall affection are violated, are extinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine may teach vs, to carry our ſelues peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and louingly towards our parents, our children, our brethren, our kinſmen, all that are of our bloud. There cannot be a greater bond betweene man and man, <hi>as men;</hi> then is this bond of bloud. I ſay preciſely betweene man and man, <hi>as men,</hi> there cannot be a greater bond, then is this bond of bloud. For betweene man and man, <hi>as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> there is a greater bond; the bond of <hi>one Lord, one faith, one baptiſme, one God,</hi> and <hi>Father of all,</hi> which is <hi>aboue all,</hi> and <hi>through all,</hi> and <hi>in you all,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <p>

                  <p>You ſee the ſtrength of the bond of bloud, how forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is betweene man and man, <hi>as men.</hi> I told you of a ſtronger bond betweene man and man, <hi>as Chriſtians,</hi> and that was the bond of <hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſme, one God</hi> and <hi>Father of all,</hi> which is <hi>aboue all,</hi> and <hi>through all,</hi> and <hi>in vs all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So there is a two-fold kinred, or brotherhood. The one, by <hi>nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> the other by <hi>grace:</hi> the one, by <hi>generation,</hi> the other, by <hi>regeneration.</hi> In reſpect of both, we are tyed with bonds of loue. Firſt, in reſpect of the former. After <hi>Noahs</hi> floud, there was a diuiſion of countreyes made to the remainder of <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity: ſome dwelt heere, ſome there; ſome in one place, ſome in another, as they beſt liked; yet one bloud remained amongſt them, as a knot euer to ioyne them in amity and loue, what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of place ſoeuer ſeuered them. Is it not ſo ſtill, though longer time, and larger encreaſe haue ſpred it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Yes (Beloued) it is ſo.

                  </p>
                  <p>This truth hath ſundry times been recommended vnto you. Diuerſe were the vſes of it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt was, to leſſon vs to looke heedefully vnto our feet; that wee walke not in the way of ſinners, to partake with them in their ſinnes. <hi>Sinnes</hi> are not tongue-tyed; they cry aloud vnto the <hi>Lord</hi> for <hi>vengeance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond was, to admoniſh vs, not to intermeddle in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1736:157"/> the Lords office; Its his office to execute <hi>vengeance.</hi> Wee therefore may not interpoſe our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>The third was, to miniſter a word of comfort to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, againſt whom the wicked, do behaue themſelues proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and deſpiteouſly.

                  <p>Of this doctrine heeretofore.</p>
                  <p>The vſe of it is, to teach vs how to carry our ſelues at ſuch times, as God ſhall viſit vs with his rod of correction; how to behaue our ſelues in all our afflictions. Wee are not ſo much to looke to the meanes, as to the <hi>Lord,</hi> that worketh by them. If the fire, or water, or any other of Gods creatures, ſhall at any time rage, and preuaile againſt vs, we muſt know, that God by them worketh his holy will vpon vs.</p>
                  <p>Heere wee ſee; God reſolueth <hi>to ſend a fire vpon Moab,</hi> which ſhould <hi>deuoure the palaces of Kerioth:</hi> which was the third circumſtance.</p>
                  <p>Muſt <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Kerioth,</hi> two chiefe cities of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Moab,</hi> through the fire of Gods wrath be brought to ruine? it yeelds this doctrine:</p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:1736:157"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>No munition, no fortification, no ſtrength can ſaue that city, which God will haue deſtroyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One vſe of this Doctrine is to leſſon vs; that we put not any confidence in any worldly helpe; but that ſo we vſe all good meanes of our defenſe, that ſtill wee rely vpon the <hi>Lord,</hi> for ſtrength and ſucceſſe thereby.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Vſe is, to put vs in minde of the fearefull pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, which God layeth vpon men for ſinne. He deuoureth their cities, throweth downe their ſtrong holds, and ſpares them not.</p>
                  <p>A third Vſe is, to ſtirre vs vp to thankfulnes, for that it pleaſeth God in mercy to ſpare, not onely our Cities, and ſtrong holds, but alſo our country villages and poore cottages.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be paſſed ouer without obſeruation, that the palaces of <hi>Kerioth</hi> are here threatned, to be deuoured with this fire, ſent from the <hi>Lord.</hi> Were I now to ſpeake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Princes, or great Eſtates, I could from hence giue them an <hi>Item,</hi> that they ſet not their hearts ouermuch vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their caſtles, towers, manſion houſes, faire palaces, or other goodly buildings, for as much as, if their ſinnes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it, the fire of Gods wrath will deuoure all thoſe. But my auditorie is of another rancke. Yet may you take a leſſon hence. Muſt the palaces of <hi>Carioth,</hi> for the ſinnes of the inhabitants be deuoured with fire from the wrath of God? Your leſſon is:</p>
                  <p>God depriueth vs of a great bleſſing, when he taketh from vs our dwelling houſes.</p>
                  <p>The great commoditie or contentment, that commeth to euery one of vs by our dwelling houſes, hath experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally made good vnto vs this truth. The Vſes of it are diuers.</p>
                  <p>One is, to teach vs to be humble before Almighty God, whenſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe him to take from vs our dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling houſes.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond is, to admoniſh vs, ſith we peaceably enioy our dwelling houſes, that we vſe them to the furtherance of Gods glory.</p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:1736:158"/>
                  <p>A third is, to ſtirre vs vp to bleſſe and praiſe God day by day for the comfortable vſe we haue of our dwelling houſes.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things I haue heretofore laboured to lay vnto your hearts, occaſioned by the like generall commination or denuntiation of iudgement (fiue times repeated) in the former chapter, againſt the <hi>Syrians,</hi> the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> the <hi>Edomites,</hi> and the <hi>Ammonites.</hi> Now we are to conſider what is more ſpecially prophecied againſt theſe <hi>Moabites.</hi> For the eaſier explication whereof, I obſerued two points:
<list>
                        <item>1. The manner of the puniſhment.</item>
                        <item>2. The extent of it.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Order requireth that firſt I ſpeake to the manner of their puniſhment, expreſſed in theſe words: <hi>And Moab ſhall dye with tumult, with ſhouting, and with the ſound of a trumpet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moab ſhall dye] Moab</hi> is here put for the <hi>Moabites,</hi> the people of <hi>Moab,</hi> the inhabitants of the Kingdome of <hi>Moab. Moab ſhall dye</hi>] There is a ciuill death, there is a corporall death, there is a ſpirituall death, and there is an eternall death. Which of theſe deaths were the <hi>Moabites</hi> to dye? The letter of my text is for the corporall death. This corporall death is a ſeparation of the ſoule from the bodie: it is called corporall, in reſpect of the ſpirituall: it is alſo called a temporarie death, in reſpect of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. This death corporall, or temporarie, is twofold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either naturall, or accidentall; if accidentall, it is ſubdiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into a violent, or a voluntarie death: and is common as well to the godly, as to the wicked; inflicted vpon them, by Gods iuſt iudgment for the ſinne of <hi>Adam.</hi> This is the wages of ſin, and this is the way of all ſinfull fleſh. <hi>All must once dye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may a long time wraſtle with the dangers of this world both by Land and Sea: thouſands may fall on our right hand, and ten thouſands on our left, while we ſtande
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1736:158"/> we may haue ſo good ſtore of friends, that we may well ſay with the <hi>Shunamite,</hi> 2. <hi>King.</hi> 4.13. <hi>I neede no ſpeaking for me, either to the King, or to the Captaine of the Hoſte; I dwell among mine owne people,</hi> where I can command: we may walke in the light of the ſunne, that is, our proſperitie may be waxen ſo great, that we want nothing: we may haue ſailes and oares at pleaſure, as <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſeemed to haue, <hi>who thought in his pride to make men ſaile vpon the dry land, and to walke vpon the Sea:</hi> 2. <hi>Mac.</hi> 5.21. we may thinke our ſelues to be in league with death, and in couenant with the graue, and ſo promiſe to our ſelues, many a proſperous, and pleaſant day, as many as are the ſands of the Ocean: yet a time ſhall come, when all theſe things ſhall proue but vanitie: and <hi>Moab ſhall dye. All must once dye.</hi>

                     <hi>Moab ſhall dye] All must once dye. Death!</hi> It is of all miſeries the laſt, and the moſt terrible. A holy<note n="k" place="margin">Apud Lud. Granatenſem Exercit de Orat. &amp; Medit.</note> Father hath made againſt it this exclamation. <hi>O Death how bitter is the remembance of thee? How quickly and ſuddainely ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest thou vpon vs? How ſecret are thy paths and wayes? How
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1736:159"/> doubtfull is thy houre? How vniuerſall is thy ſigniorie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion? The mighty cannot eſcape thee; the wiſe cannot hide themſelues from thee; the ſtrong looſe their ſtrength before thee; the rich with their money ſhall not corrupt thee. Thou art the hammer, that alwayes ſtriketh: Thou art the ſword, that neuer blunteth: thou art the ſnare, wherein all must be taken: thou art the priſon, wherein all must lye: thou art the Sea, wherein all must periſh: thou art the paine, that all muſt ſuffer: thou art the tribute, that all muſt pay.</hi> In a word; thou art ſuch a one, as Almighty God waſheth his hands of thee, and cleareth himſelfe in plaine words, by the mouth of the Wiſeman, ſaying, (<hi>Wiſd.</hi> 1.13.) <hi>that he neuer made thee.</hi> Surely thou haſt thine entry into the world by the very enuie, and craft of the Deuill.</p>
                  <p>This exclamation againſt <hi>Death</hi> is very iuſt in ſome ſenſe: for <hi>Death</hi> may be conſidered in a double reſpect; one way, as it is in its owne nature; another way, as it is changed, and qualified by the death of <hi>Christ. Death</hi> in its owne nature is a puniſhment of ſin, a plague, a curſe, or fore-runner of condemnation, the very gates, and ſuburbs of Hell it ſelfe: and in this reſpect the forecited excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation hath due place. But on the other ſide, <hi>death</hi> being changed, and qualified by <hi>Chriſt</hi> his death, it is no more ſuch; it is no more a puniſhment of ſinne; it is no more a plague; it is no more a curſe. For it is become a bleſſing; it brings an end to all our miſeries; it giues full deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to all our miſeries; it giues full deliuerance from all dangers; it is made vnto vs a paſſage, a way, an entrance into euerlaſting life; it is like a portall, or litle gate, by which we paſſe from out this litle priſon of our bodies into the kingdome of Heauen. The graue meane while is, but a reſting chamber, ſweetly perfumed by the Death of <hi>Christ</hi> for our bodies; from whence at the ſound of the laſt trumpet, our bodies ſhall awake, and riſe, and be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into the paradiſe of heauen, to enioy the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable preſence of Almighty God there.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>death</hi> now changed and qualified by <hi>Chriſt</hi> his death,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1736:159"/> be a bleſſing: if it be but a paſſage from this wretched life to that happieſt eſtate in heauen, why ſhould death be feared?</p>
                  <p>This is a Caſe of Conſcience, and may be reſolued. There are two ſorts of men in the world: the one of them, who liue in their ſinnes, and dye without repentance: the other of them, who with vnfeigned repentance and faith in <hi>Christ,</hi> doe leaue this world. The firſt haue great reaſon to feare <hi>Death: Death</hi> being vnto them the very gate, and introduction into the Hell of the damned: of whom we may well ſay, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid of <hi>Iudas, Math.</hi> 26.24. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it had bin good for them, had they neuer bin borne. The ſecond haue no reaſon to feare <hi>Death; Death</hi> being vnto them, as the gate of Heauen. To ſuch, <hi>Optimum est naſci,</hi> its beſt that they are borne; and the next beſt for them is, <hi>mature mori,</hi> to dye in a good houre. Their birth is to them a preparation to eternall happineſſe, whereof their <hi>Death</hi> giues them full poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>The conſideration whereof made King Salomon the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of Kings, or men, <hi>[praferre diem mortis, diei ortûs;]</hi> it made him preferre the day of death, before the day of birth; his words are <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.3. <hi>Better is the day of death, then the day that one is borne.</hi> Hence is it, that moſt righteous <hi>Iob,</hi> chap. 17.14. calls <hi>Corruption</hi> his <hi>father;</hi> for as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren haue fathers for their comfort, ſo had <hi>Iob</hi> death, and rottenneſſe: Corruption it ſelfe, as a father, made <hi>Iob</hi> fit for his graue and death; which of him was more wiſhed then life: as <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>Olympiodor</hi> haue well obſerued. And hence it is that bleſſed <hi>Paul,</hi> liuing in this world, and vſing it, as if he vſed it not, (for he had his conuerſation in heauen, and had a true, and liuely taſte of the ioyes of the world to come) deſired to be diſſolued, and to be with <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and this (hee was well aſſured) was beſt of all for him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre (beloued) haue I ledde you by occaſion of theſe words, <hi>Moab ſhall dye:</hi> vpon which I grounded this generall doctrine.</p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:1736:160"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All muſt once dye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the illuſtration whereof, I ſignified that of euils, <hi>death</hi> was the moſt terrible. To arme your Chriſtian ſoules a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the terrour or feare of <hi>death,</hi> I told you, that <hi>death</hi> is to be conſidered in a double reſpect; either as it is in its owne nature, or as it is changed, &amp; qualified by the death of Chriſt: in the firſt reſpect, it is very fearefull to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man: in the latter, it is very welcome to the reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Chriſtian. I further added, that there are two ſorts of men obnoxious vnto <hi>death:</hi> the one ſort doe liue in ſinne, and dye without repentance: the other with vnfained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and true faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi> doe leaue this world; to the firſt ſort <hi>death</hi> is very terrible: to the latter it is a very welcome gueſt. Now proceed we to examine the manner of <hi>Moabs</hi> death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moab ſhall dye with tumult, with ſhouting, and with the ſound of a trumpet.] In tumultu,</hi> with a tumult, ſo ſome do reade, <hi>

The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world is, that <hi>Moab</hi> ſhould die a death ſtrange and extraordinary: which is more ſpecified in the next word.</p>

                     <hi>With ſhouting.]</hi> This very word we met with within the 14. verſe of the firſt Chapter, where it is brought to ſet forth the terrour of that iudgement, which God would bring vpon the <hi>Ammonites.</hi> The word I expounded in my 20.

To make good this expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition it is added.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>With the ſound of a trumpet.]</hi> The vſe of trumpets in warre
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1736:160"/> hath beene very ancient. The vſe of them is commanded to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Num. 10.9. <hi>When ye goe to warre againſt the enemie, yee ſhall blow a larme with the trumpets.</hi> After, they were vſed in the battle againſt <hi>Iericho,</hi> Ioſh. 6.5. <hi>Ioſhua</hi> ſaith to the people: <hi>When yee heare the ſound of the trumpet, ye ſhall all ſhout with a great ſhout, and the wall of</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo <hi>ſhall fall downe flat.</hi> To this vſe <hi>Ezechiel</hi> alludeth Chap. 7.14. <hi>They haue blowne the trumpet, and prepared all, but none goeth to the battell.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of it, 1. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. 14.8. <hi>If the trumpet giue an vncertaine ſound, who ſhall prepare himſelfe to battle?</hi> The Prophet <hi>Zephanie</hi> alſo hath reſpect vnto it, Chap. 2.16. where he calls the great day of the <hi>Lord, a day of the trumpet, and a larme againſt the ſtrong Cities, and againſt the high towers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this ancient vſe of trumpets, we may gather the meaning of our Prophet in this place. <hi>Moab ſhall dye, with a tumult, with a ſhouting, and with the ſound of a trumpet] Moab]</hi> that is, the <hi>Moabites,</hi> the people of <hi>Moab, ſhall dye]</hi> ſhall depart this life, and leaue this world, not quietly, and peaceably, in their beds, <hi>but with a tumult, with a ſhouting, and with the ſound of a trumpet]</hi> euen in warre, or as the phraſe is in the 14. verſe of the 1. chapter, <hi>in the day of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile.</hi> The doctrine ariſing hence is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Warre, one of the executioners of Gods vengeance, is euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more ſent vpon a Land, for the ſinnes of the people.</hi>

                  <p>That <hi>warre</hi> is one of the executioners of Gods venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, its plaine in <hi>Ezech.</hi> 14.21. There God himſelf makes it one of his foure ſore iudgements. The foure are; the <hi>ſword, famine,</hi> the <hi>noyſome beaſt,</hi> and the <hi>peſtilence;</hi> the firſt is the ſword, an inſtrument for warre, for warre it ſelfe. Theſe foure are likewiſe couched togither in <hi>Ezech.</hi> 5.17. where thus ſaith the <hi>Lord</hi> againſt <hi>Ieruſalem: I will ſend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you famine, and euill beaſts, and they ſhall ſpoyle thee, and peſtilence and bloud ſhall through thee, and I will bring thee ſword vpon thee; I the Lord haue ſpoken it.</hi> I will bring the <hi>ſword</hi> vpon thee: the <hi>ſword,</hi> that is, warre; an inſtrument of warre, for warre it ſelfe: as in the former place.</p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:1736:161"/>
                  <p>Theſe two places of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> (to omit many other, as pregnant, here and there diſperſed throughout the ſacred Volumes of Gods eternall word) theſe two doe ſpeake plainely, that <hi>warre is one of the executioners of Gods ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</hi> That it is ſent vpon a Land for the ſinnes of the people, I made it plaine vnto you by like euidence of holy Writ in my 20. Sermon vpon the former chapter. My proofes were taken from <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.25. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.49. <hi>Ierem. 5.</hi>15. Whence I inferred, that <hi>warre,</hi> and all the euills of <hi>warre</hi> are from the <hi>Lord;</hi> that <hi>warre</hi> is one of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments of Gods iudgements; that <hi>warre</hi> is ſent by God vpon a Land for the ſinnes of a people. So goeth my doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Warre, one of the executioners of Gods vengeance, is euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more ſent vpon a Land for the ſinnes of the people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Vſe of this Doctrine is, to raiſe vs vp to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the wonderfull patience of Almighty God. We grieue the Holy Spirit of that ſacred Maieſtie with our manifold and daily ſinnes: our ſinnes of omiſſion, our ſins of infirmitie, and our ſinnes of preſumption; our ſinnes of ignorance, and our ſinnes of wilfulneſſe; our ſtrife, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, and debate; our vſurie, oppreſſion, and cruelty; our vncleanneſſe, wantonnes, and drunkennes; our ſins multiply as the ſands of the Sea, they haue preſſed into Gods preſence to fetch downe his vengeance vpon vs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, looke about you, and admire his exceeding great patience. The loud crying of our ſinnes hath not yet vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the <hi>Lord</hi> ſo farre, as to make him come againſt vs with his ſoreſt iudgement of <hi>warre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He hath out of his fatherly loue ouer vs mildely chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed vs. Not long ſince hee brake the ſtaffe of our bread, and ſent among vs a dearth and ſcarcitie; yet haue wee not returned vnto him. Not long ſince he commanded his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of waters to iſſue from out their channell, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer runne man and beaſt for many miles within this land; yet haue we not returned vnto him. Not long ſince he let flye his arrowes of peſtilence, and yet they flye abroad to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1736:161"/> the killing of many round about vs; yet haue wee not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned vnto him.</p>
                  <p>Not returned vnto him? What? Can no medicine, that God applyeth, mollifie our hard hearts? Can none of his corrections amend vs? Will we needs try whether he will ſend a ſword vpon vs? He ſhaked his <hi>ſword</hi> ouer vs, (many of vs may well remember it) when <hi>the great Spaniſh Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> floated on our Seas: but then as S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh, chap. 2.13. <hi>Super exaltauit miſericordia iudicio,</hi> mercy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted it ſelfe aboue iudgement, and we were ſpared.</p>
                  <p>Were we ſpared? What ſhall we render to the <hi>Lord</hi> for ſo great mercy? We will with <hi>Dauid, Pſ.</hi> 116.13. <hi>We will take the cup of ſaluation,</hi> we wil <hi>call vpon the name of the Lord,</hi> and will <hi>offer vnto him the ſacrifice of prayſe.</hi> Which ſacrifice of ours, that it may be acceptable to the <hi>Lord,</hi> let vs caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from vs all our tranſgreſſions, whereby we haue tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed; and with a new heart, and a new ſpirit, returne we to the <hi>Lord</hi> our God. But if we will perſiſt with delight, and goe on in our old wayes; our crooked, peruerſe, and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wayes; our wayes of wickedneſſe; and will not bee turned out of them by any of <hi>God</hi> his milder chaſtiſements and corrections, what can we expect, but the portion of theſe <hi>Moabites,</hi> euen <hi>fire</hi> &amp; a <hi>ſword</hi> from the <hi>Lord,</hi> and with them to die <hi>with a tumult, with a ſhouting, and with the ſound of a Trumpet?</hi>

The meaning is: there was no cittie in the Kingdome of <hi>Moab</hi> ſo ſtrong, but that from out the midſt of it, God would fetch the <hi>King,</hi> and cut him off.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will cut off,</hi> roote out, or deſtroy, <hi>the iudge,</hi> the King, out of the middeſt of the ſtrongeſt cittie of the Kingdome of <hi>Moab,</hi> be it <hi>Moab, Kerioth,</hi> or any other; <hi>I will ſlay all the Princes thereof with him;</hi> together with the King I will root out all the Princes of the land. None ſhall eſcape my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, neither Prince, nor King.

                     </gap> ſayth the <hi>Lord.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> hath ſaid it, that neither Prince nor King ſhall be exempt from his iudgements; but ſhall as well as the loweſt of the people be cut off, and come to nought.</p>
                  <p>The doctrine to be obſerued from hence is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God exerciſeth his iudgements, not onely vpon men of low and baſe eſtate, but alſo vpon the great ones of this world; vpon prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Kings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This truth I haue heretofore confirmed vnto you, in my 21. Lecture, on the former Chapter, handling thoſe words Chap. 1. verſ. 15. <hi>Their King ſhall goe into captiuitie he, and his Princes together,</hi> I proued vnto you this doctrine, <hi>When God puniſheth a nation with captiuitie for their ſinnes, he ſpareth neither Prieſt, nor Prince, nor King.</hi> My now-doctrine for ſubſtance is the ſame, but more generall; <hi>God exerciſeth his iudgements not onely vpon men of low &amp; baſe eſtate, but alſo vpon the great ones of this world; vpon Princes &amp; Kings.</hi> The vſes.</p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:1736:162"/>
                  <p>One is to admoniſh the great and mightie ones of this world, that they preſume not to ſinne againſt the Lord, as if they were priuiledged by their greatnes, and might. There is no ſuch priuiledge. He that is <hi>Lord</hi> ouer all, will ſpare no perſon. Princes, and Kings muſt feele the ſmart of his iudgements.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond vſe is, to miniſter comfort to ſuch as are of low and baſe eſtate. If the mightie by violence, and oppreſſion grind your faces, and compaſſe you about, yet be not yee diſcouraged; God the iudge of all accepteth no perſons. He in his good time will auenge your cauſes, be your op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſours neuer ſo mightie. For Princes and Kings muſt feele the ſmart of his iudgements.</p>
                  <p>A third vſe is, a warning for our ſelues; that we ſet not our hearts vpon the outward things of this world, for as much as God, the Creator of all, will not reſpect vs for them. Doſt thou glory in this that thou art a mightie man, or a rich man? For both, might and riches, Princes, and Kings are far beyond thee: yet muſt Princes and Kings feele the ſmart of Gods iudgements.</p>
                  <p>Let vs make a fourth vſe of this doctrine, euen to poure out our ſoules in thankefulneſſe before almightie God, for his wonderfull patience towards vs. Our ſinnes are as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, as euer were the ſinnes of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> Our three and foure tranſgreſſions, our many ſinnes doe cry aloud to Heauen againſt vs, as the ſins of the <hi>Moabites</hi> cryed againſt them. For their ſinnes God ſent a ſword vpon them, and did cut them off from being a nation; Gods wrath againſt our ſinnes, hath not yet proceeded ſo farre. We yet enioy our happie peace. Euery man dwels vnder his owne vine, and vnder his owne figtree; and liues in the habitations of his forefathers in peace, free from all feare of the enemies ſword. Such is our condition, through the neuer-too-much admired patience of Almightie God. O let vs not deſpiſe the riches of the bountifulneſſe, patience, and long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our God. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> tells vs. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. That theſe doe lead vs to Repentance.</p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:1736:163"/>
                  <p>Theſe doe lead vs; ſhall we not follow? Beloued, while we haue time, let vs betake our ſelues to Repentance.

                  <p>OVr Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> hath hitherto dealt with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Nations, with the <hi>Syrians,</hi> with the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines,</hi> with the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> with the <hi>Edomites,</hi> with the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and with the <hi>Moabites.</hi> Six in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.

To each of theſe you haue heard the iudgements of God menaced, his puniſhments threatned: all which are accordingly fallen out.</p>
                  <p>Was not <hi>Amos</hi> his meſſage from the <hi>Lord</hi> to the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites?</hi> Why then doth he firſt foretell forraine nations their iudgements? The reaſons are three;</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, that they might the more ſtand in awe at the words of this prophecie, when they ſhould behold the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> and other their neighbours, afflicted and tormented, according to the haynouſneſſe of their iniquities.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thus ſayth the Lord]</hi> not, <hi>Thus ſayth Amos:</hi> but <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> then is the author of this Scripture; and not of this onely, but alſo of the whole bodie of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The doctrine,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The author of holy Scripture is neither man, nor Angell, nor any other creature, how eminent, or excellent ſoeuer, but onely the liuing, and immortall God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This doctrine I haue heretofore commended vnto you in my firſt lecture vpon this Chapter. The vſes of it were three.</p>
                  <p>The firſt concerned vs, whom God hath ſet apart to be the Preachers, and expounders of the Scriptures. We muſt handle them as the holy word of God. As my Prophet here comes to <hi>Iudah,</hi> ſo muſt we to you, with, <hi>thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> we may not ſpeake, either the imagination of our <hi>owne braines,</hi> or the vaine perſwaſions of our <hi>owne hearts;</hi> we muſt ſincerely preach vnto you Gods gracious word, without corrupting, or deprauing it.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond vſe concerneth you, who are auditors, and hearers of the word preached. It is your parts to giue eare vnto it with attetion and reuerence; and like the <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians]</hi> commended by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13.] to receiue it, not as the word of vs <hi>men:</hi> but, as it is indeed, the <hi>word of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:1736:165"/>
                  <p>A third vſe concerned the aduerſaries of the truth; the <hi>Papiſts</hi> who doe vilifie, and debaſe the ſacred Scriptures, and eſteeme not of them, as of the <hi>word of God.</hi> How ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully they haue loaded this <hi>holy word of God</hi> with diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full termes, calling it, <hi>a doubtful vncertaine, and a leaden rule, a poore kinde of element, a booke of diſcord, a matter of debate, dead inke, inken divinitie, a dumbe iudge, a noſe of waxe, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſops fables,</hi> I haue<note n="g" place="margin">Lect. <hi>2.</hi> in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos <hi>1.</hi> pag. <hi>18.</hi> &amp;c.</note> heretofore deliuered vnto you.</p>
                  <p>But who are they, out of whoſe mouths, and pens, ſuch bitterneſſe againſt Gods holy word hath beene vented? Are they our Countrymen? Are they not rather ſtrangers to vs, <hi>Papiſts</hi> of other Nations? <hi>Pighius, Hoſius, Gretſer, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Lewis</hi> of <hi>Lateran,</hi> the <hi>collocutors</hi> at <hi>Wormes,</hi> and <hi>Ratiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon?</hi> What are theſe to vs?

We haue no inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in the ſonne of Iſchai: to your tents, O Iſrael: now ſee to thine owne houſe, Dauid.</hi> So they forſooke <hi>Rehoboam</hi> their rightfull Lord, and ſet vp vnto themſelues a wew King, <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> ſonne of <hi>Nebat:</hi> yet were theſe children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who dwelt in the cities of <hi>Iudah,</hi> ſubiect to <hi>Rehoboam</hi> ſtill.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee, <hi>Iſrael</hi> diuided from <hi>Iſrael:</hi> ten tribes from the other two. Two tribes; the tribes of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Benia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> continued in their obedience to the houſe of <hi>Dauid:</hi> the other ten tribes forſooke it, and fell away.</p>
                  <p>The ten reuolted tribes haue diuerſe appellations in the ſanctified writings of the holy Prophets: <hi>Bethel, Bethauen, Samaria, Iezreel, Ioſeph, Ephraim, Iacob, Iſrael:</hi> theſe names are appropriate, to ſignifie the <hi>Kingdome of Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other two tribes, <hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Beniamin,</hi> called but one tribe in the 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.13. becauſe of the mixture of their poſſeſſions, theſe two tribes ſetled in their faithfulnes and obedience to the ſeede of <hi>Dauid,</hi> haue likewiſe in the ſacred Scriptures their diuers appellations. Sometimes <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Beniamin,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Sion,</hi> ſometimes <hi>the houſe of Dauid,</hi> are peculiarly
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1736:168"/> deſigned to ſignifie the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iudah</hi> is one of theſe appellations, and that is the <hi>Iudah</hi> in my text, <hi>properly,</hi> verſ. 5. <hi>I will ſend a fire vpon Iudah,</hi> that is, vpon the <hi>Kingdome of Iudah.</hi> And by a figure, in this firſt branch of this propheſie, where <hi>Iudah</hi> is put for the <hi>inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the kingdom of Iudah.</hi> Thus haue you the parties ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, the inhabitants of the kingdom of <hi>Iudah.</hi> But wherof are they accuſed? Of ſinning againſt the Lord. So goeth the letter of my text; <hi>For three tranſgreſſions of Iudah, &amp; for foure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What are theſe three and foure tranſgreſſions? <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> makes three of them to bee, <hi>man-ſlaughter, inceſt,</hi> and <hi>idolatry:</hi> The firſt is <hi>man-ſlaughter. Eſay</hi> poynts at it, chap. 1.15. <hi>Your hands are full of bloud.</hi> The ſecond is <hi>inceſt. Ieremie</hi> poynts at it, chap. 23.10. <hi>The land is full of adulterers.</hi> The third is <hi>idolatry. Hoſeah</hi> poynts at it, chap. 1.2. <hi>The land hath committed great whoredome, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the Lord.</hi> The fourth, which of all, is the moſt flagicious and hainous, is expreſſed in this text; and it is their reiecting, aboliſhing, or diſanulling of Gods lawes and commandements.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For three tranſgreſſions of Iudah, and for foure.] Albertus</hi> the Great, B. of <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> will haue three of theſe tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to be expreſſed in this text. The firſt of them is, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis abiectio,</hi> the abiection, or contempt of Gods Law: <hi>They haue despiſed the law of the Lord.</hi> The ſecond is, <hi>praeceptorum non obſeruatio,</hi> the not obſeruing of Gods commandements: <hi>They haue not kept his commandements.</hi> The third is, <hi>ad Idola conuerſio:</hi> their conuerſion to Idols: <hi>Their lies cauſed them to erre, after which their fathers haue walked.</hi> Theſe three you ſee expreſſed in the text. But what is the fourth? It is <hi>Sacrati loci prophanatio,</hi> the prophanation of the hallowed place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For three tranſgreſſions of Iudah, and for foure] Paulus de Palatio</hi> doth otherwiſe deſcant vpon theſe <hi>three and foure tranſgreſſions.</hi> The firſt he will haue to be committed by <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horam,</hi> ſon of <hi>Iehoſaphat,</hi> King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> who to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſtrong in his Kingdome, ſlue with the ſword ſix of his brethren, and ſome of the Princes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 21.4.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1736:169"/> The ſecond by <hi>Ioaſh,</hi> ſonne of <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> who allured by the flattery of ſome of his Princes, ſlew <hi>Zacharias,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iehoiada:</hi> or <hi>Barachias,</hi> betweene the temple and the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.21. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.35. The third, by King <hi>Amaziah,</hi> who, lifted vp with pride for his victory obtained againſt the <hi>Edomites,</hi> did prouoke the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to fight, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.17. Thus haue you <hi>three</hi> of theſe <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions.</hi> The <hi>fourth,</hi> ſaith this <hi>Paulus de Palatio,</hi> needes no enquiry. And why ſo? <hi>Amos</hi> in this text declares it. The Kingdome of <hi>Iudah</hi> from <hi>Rehoboams</hi> time was moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe vnto idolatry: from that time, they <hi>caſt away the law of the Lord,</hi> they <hi>kept not his commandements,</hi> they <hi>ſerued Idols, after which their fathers walked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For three tranſgreſſions of Iudah, and for foure]</hi> This phraſe we met with fiue times in the former chapter, and once in this. The moſt naturall, proper, and ſignificant expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, heeretofore commended vnto you, is this: to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by <hi>three and foure,</hi> many. A number finite and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, is put for a number infinite and vncertaine. <hi>For three tranſgreſſions of Iudah, and for foure;</hi> that is, for many tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions. As oft, as hee will, God forgiueth, though wee ſinne many a time. It is but the cuſtome of the <hi>Scripture</hi> thus to ſpeake: God waiteth for vs <hi>twice and thrice,</hi> that is, a good while, to haue vs returne from our euill wayes vnto repentance: but the <hi>fourth</hi> time, that is, at length, when he ſeeth vs perſiſt in our impenitency, hee proteſteth againſt vs, as heere againſt <hi>Iudah, I will not turne to you,</hi> I will not turne away your puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will not turne away the puniſhment thereof]</hi> Theſe words are diuerſly rendered: by <hi>Gualter, non conuertam eum,</hi> I will not turne <hi>Iudah,</hi> I will not recall him into the right way; he ſhall runne to his owne perdition. By <hi>Mercer: non par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam ei,</hi> I will not ſpare <hi>Iudah:</hi> according as his deſert ſhall be, ſo ſhall he haue. In our Engliſh-<hi>Geneua</hi> tranſlation, <hi>I will not turne to it.</hi> In our late Church-Bible, <hi>I will not ſpare him.</hi> In our neweſt tranſlation, <hi>I will not turne away the puniſhment thereof.</hi> So read <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius,</hi>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:1736:169"/> according to the Hebrew, <hi>Non auertam iſtud,</hi> I will not turne away this puniſhment, which I haue reſolued to lay vpon <hi>Iudah.</hi> The ſumme of both accuſation and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation is this. If <hi>Iudah</hi> had ſinned but once, or a ſecond time, I would haue beene fauourable to them, and would haue recalled him into the right way, that ſo they might haue been conuerted, and might haue eſcaped my puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but now whereas they doe daily heape tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vpon tranſgreſſion, and make no end of ſinning, I haue hardened my face againſt them, I will not turne them vnto me, I will not turne to them, I will not ſpare them, I will not turne away the puniſhment, which I haue reſolued to bring vpon them; but indurate and obſtinate, as they are, I will vtterly deſtroy them. <hi>For three tranſgreſſions of Iudah, and for foure, I will not turne away the puniſhment thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus haue you the expoſition of the two firſt parts of this prophecie; of the <hi>accuſation</hi> of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and the Lords <hi>proteſtation</hi> againſt them. Now let vs ſee what doctrin may bee taken hence for our further inſtruction, and the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our liues. Doth God reſolue to puniſh <hi>Iudah,</hi> for <hi>three &amp; foure tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſſions?</hi> The doctrin ariſing hence is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Three tranſgreſſions, and foure,</hi> that is, many ſinnes, <hi>doe prouoke Almighty God to lay his puniſhments vpon vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God is of pure eyes, and beholdeth no iniquity. Hee hath layd righteouſneſſe to the rule, and weighed his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in a ballance. His ſentence is paſſed forth, and ſtands, like the law of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> irreuocable: Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation and anguiſh, vpon euery ſoule that doth euill. The ſoule that ſinneth, it ſelfe muſt beare the puniſhment. God makes it good with an oath, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.41. that hee <hi>will whet his glittering ſword, and his hand ſhall take hold on iudgement, to execute vengeance</hi> for ſinne. His ſoule hateth, and abhorreth ſinne; his law curſeth and condemneth ſinne; his hand ſmiteth and ſcourgeth ſinne. Sinne was his motiue to caſt Angels out of Heauen, to thruſt <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe, to turne Cities into aſhes, to ruinate Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to torment his owne bowels in the ſimilitude of ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1736:170"/> fleſh. Sinne made him heretofore to drowne the olde world; and ſinne will make him hereafter to burne this. So true is my doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Many ſinnes doe prouoke Almighty God to lay his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vpon vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let vs now make ſome vſe of this doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Doe many ſinnes cauſe Almighty God to puniſh vs? Firſt, we are hence taught, at what time ſoeuer God ſhall lay his rod vpon vs, to ſeeke the true cauſe thereof in our ſelues. <hi>Malorum omnium noſtrorum cauſa, peccatum eſt,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> Serm. 139. <hi>de Tempore.</hi> The cauſe of all euill is within vs: it is ſinne within vs. It is impiety to imagine, that God will puniſh vs without a cauſe. <hi>Non pateremur, niſi mereremur,</hi> ſaith that good Father; We ſhould not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe any croſſe or diſturbance, vnleſſe wee deſerued it. Wherefore let vs, euery one of vs in particular, when God commeth neere to vs in iudgement, to touch, either our eſtates with want, or our callings with diſgrace, or our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with ſicknes, or our ſoules with heauines; let vs haue recourſe to the ſinnes within vs, which haue deſerued this, and turne we to the <hi>Lord</hi> our God. Water, teares, ſorrow, repentance, will better ſatisfie him, pacifie him, mooue him, alter him, then whatſoeuer vengeance, or plagues, or bloud, or death.</p>
                  <p>Let vs enter into a due conſideration of our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, our tranſgreſſions, our ſinnes, wherewith, as with a heauy burden, wee are laden: and returne wee to the <hi>Lord</hi> our God: adulterers, murtherers, idolaters, the ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the ambitious, the couetous, drunkards, railers, lyars, the blaſphemous, ſwearers, forſwearers, all, who by any their euill wayes prouoke God to the execution of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, muſt take part in this conuerſion. Let no man draw backe; let not the heinouſneſſe of our fore-paſſed ſinnes deterre vs or keepe vs, from ſo holy a courſe. I dare affirme with S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> Serm. 181. <hi>de Tempore. Non nocent peccata praeterita, ſi non placent praeſentia.</hi> Sinnes paſt hurt not, if ſins preſent pleaſe not. Let vs euen now at this preſent in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1736:170"/> of ſinne reſolue to ſinne willingly no more, and our ſinnes paſt ſhall neuer hurt vs. O let not this vſe ſlip out of our minds. When God his heauy hand is vpon vs in any croſſe or tribulation, ſeeke wee out the cauſe of it in our ſelues, in our ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond vſe followeth: and it is to ſtirre vs vp to a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous contemplation of the wonderfull patience of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, who did ſo graciouſly forbeare thoſe inhabitants of <hi>Iudah,</hi> till by their <hi>three tranſgreſſions,</hi> and by their <hi>foure,</hi> they had prouoked God vnto diſpleaſure. The holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are frequent in proclaiming God to be <hi>mercifull,</hi> and <hi>gracious,</hi> and <hi>long-ſuffering,</hi> and <hi>of great goodneſſe.</hi> Hee cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the fooliſh, <hi>Prou.</hi> 1.22. <hi>O ye fooliſh, how long will ye loue fooliſhneſſe?</hi> He cryeth to the faithleſſe, <hi>Math.</hi> 17.17. <hi>O generation, faithleſſe and crooked, how long now ſhall I ſuffer you?</hi> He cryeth to <hi>Ieruſalem, Matth.</hi> 23.37. <hi>O Ieruſalem, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, how often?</hi> What could the Lord haue done more vnto his vineyard, then he had done vnto it? He dreſſed it with the beſt and kindlieſt husbandry that his heart could inuent, as appeareth, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 5.2. Such carefull dreſſing could not but deſerue fruit. This fruit he required not at the firſt houre, but tarried for it the full time, euen till the autumne and time of vintage; if then it failed, did it not deſerue to be eaten vp? Looke into the 13. of <hi>Luke</hi> verſ. 6. There ſhall you ſee the Lord wayting three yeeres for the fruit of his fig-tree, yea and content, that digging, and dunging, and expectation a fourth yeere may bee beſtowed vpon it. Doubtleſſe God is <hi>mercifull,</hi> and <hi>gracious,</hi> and <hi>long ſuffering,</hi> and <hi>of great goodneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Heereof (Beloued) we haue great experience. We haue our <hi>three tranſgreſſions,</hi> and our <hi>foure</hi> too, as <hi>Iudah</hi> had. Our manifold ſinnes, our ſins of omiſſion, and our ſinnes of commiſſion, our ſinnes of ignorance, and our ſinnes of wilfulneſſe, our ſinnes of infirmity, and our ſinnes of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, doe they not day by day, impudently and ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily preſſe into the preſence of Gods Maieſty, to procure his vengeance againſt vs?

                  <p>Let vs rather confeſſe the truth: that God by ſuch his forbearance doth lead vs to repentance: for as much as it is impoſſible, that God ſhould be, and not ſee; ſhould ſee, and not regard; ſhould regard, and not puniſh; ſhould puniſh, and not proportion his puniſhments to our ſinnes.

                  <p>The rule in the Scholes is thus deliuered. <hi>Culpam poena ſequitur,</hi> euery ſinne hath a due puniſhment attending it.

                     <hi>Contempt</hi> is an action of the minde, by which we nothing at all, or very lighty eſteeme of a thing, and therefore doe reiect it. This action, which I call <hi>contempt,</hi> is partly from the vnderſtanding, partly from the will. Firſt the vnderſtanding eſteemes a thing to be nothing or litle worth; then doth the will reiect it, and caſts it away.</p>
                  <p>A thing may be <hi>contemned</hi> two manner of wayes; either ſimply, or in reſpect of ſome other thing.</p>
                  <p>Firſt ſimply. So we may <hi>contemne</hi> a vile fellow, one that hath no vertue, no goodnes in him; one that is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither vicious, giuen vp<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28.</note> to a reprobate ſenſe, to drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, to wantonneſſe, to worke all kinde of wickednes, euen with greedineſſe. Such a fellow, is ſimply vnworthy to be had in any the leaſt eſtimation. Such we may, we
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1736:172"/> muſt <hi>contemne.</hi> In like ſort, if a tyrant command, that which is vniuſt, any thing that is derogatorie to the glory of God, and threatneth grieuous puniſhments, vnleſſe he be obeyed: in this caſe a good Chriſtian, muſt be of a ſtout courage; he muſt <hi>deſpiſe</hi> the vniuſt command, and the proud threats of the tyrant; his zeale muſt be only for the glory of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>The ſtorie of the three children, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. is not vnknowne to you. The King of <hi>Babylon, Nabuchodonezor</hi>

                     <hi>euery one, that ſhould heare the ſound of the cornet, trumpet, harpe, ſhawme, pſalterie, dulcimer, and other inſtruments of muſicke, ſhould fall downe, and worſhip the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den image:</hi> who ſo fell not downe, and worſhipped, <hi>hee ſhould be caſt into the middest of a hot fiery furnace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This vniuſt decree of the King, the three children, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drach, Miſach, and Abednego,</hi> regarded not: they could not be brought to worſhip this golden image; they feared not his hot fiery fornace; they knew, God was<note n="d" place="margin">

                     <hi>able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer them</hi> from thence; if God would not, yet were they reſolued in no wiſe to worſhip that image: they would not ſo much as outwardly conſent to idolatry; ſo zealous were they for the glory of God. A worthy example for my preſent purpoſe, to ſhew, that the <hi>vniust commands</hi> of Tyrants, are very iuſtly <hi>contemned</hi> and <hi>reiected.</hi> So are the commands of Magiſtrates, Parents, and other ſuperiours in authoritie, if they depriue God of his glory. If they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh, remit, or abate any thing of the glory of God, they are ſimply to be <hi>contemned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee now; a thing may be contemned <hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> ſimply. It may alſo be contemned <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſome other thing: as when a man eſteemes more of his pleaſure, or profit, then of the law of the <hi>Lord.</hi> Such an one may be ſaid <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> in reſpect of his owne pleaſure, or profit, to <hi>contemne the law of the Lord.</hi> And this <hi>contempt</hi> is a ſin. The fore-mentioned <hi>contempts,</hi> were not ſinnes. A <hi>contempt</hi> may be a ſinne, or not a ſinne. You
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1736:173"/> may diſcerne it by its <hi>obiect,</hi> or the thing <hi>contemned.</hi> If the <hi>obiect,</hi> if the thing <hi>contemned</hi> be euill, then is the <hi>contempt</hi> good; it is a vertue, its no ſinne. It is no ſinne to <hi>contemne</hi> a vicious fellow, in whom there is no ſparke of pietie: its no ſinne to <hi>contemne</hi> the impious and vniuſt commands of men placed in authoritie aboue vs, as you haue already heard. But if the <hi>obiect,</hi> if the thing <hi>contemned</hi> be good, then is the <hi>contempt</hi> euill, it is a vice, its a ſinne.

                     <hi>Obedience to the commandements of the Lord, is a dutie which the Lord requireth to be performed by euery childe of his.</hi> This truth is made as plaine, as the light at noone day, by the words of bleſſed <hi>Samuel</hi> to king <hi>Saul.</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.22. <hi>Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings, and ſacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord?

For the vnderſtanding of the phraſe in my text, you may know; there is <hi>a walking after truth,</hi> and <hi>a walking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Lyes;</hi> or which is all one, there is <hi>a walking after God,</hi> and <hi>a walking after Idols.</hi> We <hi>walke after truth,</hi> or <hi>God,</hi> when from the bottome of our hearts, we thinke vpon, and do thoſe things, which God hath preſcribed vnto vs in the word of truth; when we liue a godly life, in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world. On the other ſide, we <hi>walke after lyes,</hi> or <hi>after Idols,</hi> when we worſhip that which is not God; or when we worſhip the true God, but vpon a falſe founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, polluting and defiling his ſacred worſhip, with the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1736:182"/> fooliſh imaginations and inventions of our owne braines. Thus did the ancient Iewes <hi>walke after Lyes;</hi> which is here laid vnto their charge: <hi>Their Lyes cauſe them to erre, after which their Fathers walked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto haue you heard the expoſition of the text. Giue eare now I beſeech you to ſuch leſſons as may from hence be taken for our further inſtruction, and the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our liues. The firſt leſſon I take from theſe words, <hi>Their Lyes cauſed them to erre; their lyes,</hi> that is, their idolatrous and falſe worſhip of God, hath <hi>cauſed them to erre,</hi> hath deceiued them. The doctrine is:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When men decline or ſwerue from the preſcript of Gods word, they are forthwith enwrapped and involued in deceit; and cannot but erre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I thus explicate it. If we embrace not the truth of God, if we deſpiſe his holy Lawes, if we keepe not his commandements, we muſt of neceſſitie fall into ſupine and groſſe lyes. For ſo God permitteth. Whoſoeuer beleeue not the truth, but haue pleaſure in vnrighteouſnes; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer receiue not the loue of the truth, that they may be ſaued, to ſuch ſhall God <hi>ſend ſtrong deluſion that they ſhall beleeue lyes,</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.11.

                  </p>
                  <p>A reaſon hereof I may giue you, out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.105. where the <hi>word of God</hi> is compared to a <hi>lampe,</hi> or a <hi>light: Thy word is a lampe vnto my feete, and a light vnto my path.</hi> You know the vſe of a <hi>lampe,</hi> or <hi>light.</hi> It is to direct vs in the darke, that we erre not. Now what is this <hi>world,</hi> but <hi>a place of darkneſſe?</hi> Here the naturall man <hi>ſitteth in darknes,</hi> Luk. 1.79. he <hi>walketh in darknes,</hi> Pſal. 82.5. <hi>his eyes are blinded with darknes,</hi> 1. Ioh. 2.11. <hi>his vnderſtanding is darkned,</hi> Epheſ. 4.18. <hi>he is ſubiect to the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> Coloſſ. 1.13. he <hi>hath fellowſhip with the vnfruitfull workes of darknes,</hi> Epheſ. 5.11. he is <hi>euen darknes it ſelfe,</hi> Epheſ. 5.8. How then <hi>can he chuſe but erre,</hi> if he haue not this <hi>lampe,</hi> or <hi>light</hi> of God, <hi>the word of God,</hi> to direct him?</p>
                  <p>It was not vnvſuall, with the Iewes, to ſeeke to them, who had<note n="e" place="margin">

To reclaime them from this error, the Prophet <hi>Eſay cap.</hi> 8.20. calls them <hi>ad legem, &amp; ad teſtimonium,</hi> to the law and to the teſtimonie, that is, <hi>to the word of God.</hi> And why doth he ſo? He tells you why, in the words following: <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they ſpeake not according to this word, it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no light in them:</hi> What can be more plaine?

                  <p>You haue enough for the confirmation and illuſtration of my doctrine, which was,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When men decline, or ſwerue from the preſcript of Gods word, they are forthwith enwrapped and involued in deceit, and cannot but erre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it ſo beloued? If we leaue <hi>the word of God,</hi> are wee forthwith in <hi>errour?</hi> Let this be a ſtrong motiue to vs, to giue more diligence to <hi>the word of God,</hi> then hitherto we haue done. Let vs as we are exhorted by <hi>S. Peter</hi> in his 2. <hi>Epiſt. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. Let vs <hi>take heed vnto it, as vnto a light, that ſhineth in a darke place, till the day dawne, and the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarre ariſe in our hearts.</hi> Let vs not thinke any time miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpent, that we beſtow vpon this <hi>word of God,</hi> either to <hi>heare</hi> it, or to <hi>read</hi> it, or to <hi>keepe</hi> it. Yong men, wherewithall will you clenſe your wayes, but by taking heed vnto <hi>your wayes</hi> according to the <hi>word of God,</hi> as you are aduiſed, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.9.

If we leaue <hi>the word of God,</hi> which is the <hi>lampe</hi> and <hi>light</hi> of God, then are we forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with in <hi>darknes;</hi> we are in <hi>error.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it ſo, beloued? Then ſecondly let vs bring and offer to our gracious God, the <hi>calues of our lips,</hi> the ſacrifice of praiſe and thankſgiuing, for that it pleaſeth him for our direction in this <hi>valley of darknes</hi> and <hi>ſhadow of death,</hi> to giue vs the <hi>light</hi> of his moſt precious word.

Many there are, that haue not the <hi>light</hi> of his <hi>word.</hi> And where this <hi>light</hi> is not, there can be nothing but <hi>darknes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it ſo, beloued? Then thirdly is the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> very iniurious to the people of God, to with-hold and keepe from them this <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>word of God.</hi> Is it not plaine, they do ſo, when they forbid the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be tranſlated into any Vulgar tongue, and ſo ſeale them vp from the vnderſtanding of the ignorant and vnlearned?

                  <p>This was not the practiſe of olde. Of old time, in the primitiue times of the Church, the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> had their free paſſage. All ſorts of people might <hi>read them,</hi> might <hi>ſearch into them,</hi> might <hi>iudge of them.</hi> The vnlearned, as the learned; the laitie, as the clergie; women, as men; baſe, as noble; yong, as old; all had their ſhares in <hi>reading,</hi> in <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> in <hi>meditating,</hi> in <hi>practiſing</hi> the ſacred doctrines contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> There can be no iuſt reaſon to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>For as <hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi> in his firſt <hi>Homilie</hi> vpon <hi>S.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Their lies cauſed them to erre, after which their Fathers walked.]</hi> You haue vnderſtood by my precedent expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe words, that the Inhabitants of <hi>Iudah</hi> are here blamed, for adhering to the blind ſuperſtitions of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.

                  <p>
                     <hi>In matters of Religion we are not tyed to follow our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This truth is plainely deriued from my text, for if we will make it our rule in Religion, <hi>to follow our forefathers; their lyes,</hi> that is, their blind ſuperſtitions, and idolatrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, may deceiue vs, and cauſe vs to erre. Were not the elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thus deceiued, and brought into errour? The twentie Chapter of the prophecie of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> makes it plaine, that they were ſo: there ſhall you finde it obiected to them; that <hi>they were polluted after the manner of their fathers, and committed whoredome after the abomination of their fathers,</hi> ver. 30. And to draw them from adhering to the ill courſes of their fathers, the Lord himſelfe is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>ver.</hi> 18. 19. thus to ſpeake vnto them: <hi>Walke yee not in the ſtatutes of your fathers, neither obſerue their iudgements, nor defile yourſelues with their Idoles, I am the Lord your God: Walke in my ſtatutes, keepe my iudgements, and doe them.</hi> What will you more for the confirmation of my propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? You haue alreadie the warrant of Almightie God from heauen for it, that <hi>in matters of Religion we are not tyed to follow our forefathers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is backed with another text, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Be not as your Fathers: your Fathers they heard me not, they hearkened not vnto me, ſaith the Lord. Be not</hi> you therefore <hi>as your fathers.</hi> Your <hi>fathers tempted me in the deſert, Pſal.</hi> 95.9. Will you alſo tempt me? <hi>Be not as your Fathers.</hi> Your <hi>Fathers were a ſtubborne and rebellious generation, Pſal.</hi> 78.8. Will you alſo be <hi>ſtubborne,</hi> and <hi>rebellious? Be not as your Fathers.</hi> It is out
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1736:186"/> of doubt; Our <hi>fathers</hi> muſt not be followed in euill. Yea, in <hi>matters of Religion</hi> we are not bound to follow our <hi>Fathers.</hi> If our <hi>fathers</hi> in their religion were blinded with ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and worſhipped God otherwiſe, then they were direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Gods <hi>holy word,</hi> we are not <hi>to follow them:</hi> yea, we are plainely charged, <hi>not to be as they were:</hi> Thus briefly of my Doctrine:
<q>In matters of religion we are not tyed to follow our forefathers.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This truth ſerueth for a reproofe of <hi>Ieſuits, Prieſts, Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants,</hi> and all other <hi>popiſhly</hi> affected within this our country, who are ſo ſtrangely devoted to the <hi>Religion</hi> whereof their fathers were, that they purpoſely ſhut their eyes againſt the <hi>light</hi> of Gods word, &amp; will not ſuffer it to <hi>ſhine</hi> vpon them.

                     <hi>Litle infant, poore wretch, in warre, in famine, in ſedition, for whom ſhall I preſerue thee? for whom ſhall I ſaue thee aliue?

                  <p>The <hi>Iewes</hi> thus dead, and ſcattered, what became of their glorious cittie <hi>Ieruſalem?</hi> The holy <hi>Temple</hi> there was burnt, their ſtrong and high wals were throwne downe; all the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie became waſt and deſolate, and ſo it remaines to this day. Certainly it is befallen <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> according to this commination in my text: <hi>I will ſend a fire vpon</hi> Iudah, <hi>and it ſhall deuoure the palaces of</hi> Ieruſalem. Thus farre haue you the words of my text expounded. Now to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p>You haue heard Gods iudgments againſt the kingdome of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and the glorious Citie <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> denounced in the ſame words, as his iudgements were againſt the <hi>Syrians,</hi> the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> the <hi>Edomites,</hi> the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and the <hi>Moabites.</hi> The <hi>Syrians,</hi> the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> the <hi>Edomites,</hi> the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and the <hi>Moabites,</hi> were aliens from the Common wealth of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> they were ſtrangers from the couenant of promiſe; they had no hope, they were without God in the world. But theſe <hi>Iewes,</hi> theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> were of the Common wealth of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> God made his couenant with them; they were not without hope; they were the people of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi> was their God: yet becauſe they ſinned againſt the <hi>Lord,</hi> as the forenamed Gentiles did, the <hi>Lord</hi> was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to deale with them, as with the Gentiles; euen to <hi>ſend a fire vpon Iudah,</hi> which hath long ſince deuoured the palaces
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1736:191"/> of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> The doctrine which from hence I commend vnto you, is;
<q>Whoſoeuer doe imitate the Heathen in their impieties, they are in the Lords account no better then the Heathen, and ſhall be puniſhed as the Heathen.</q>

According to theſe, God in iudgement <hi>reſpecteth</hi> no man. Whoſoeuer he be, <hi>Iew,</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> male, or female, poore and rich, bond or free, learned, or vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that feareth God, and worketh righteouſneſſe, hee is <hi>accepted</hi> with God, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.35. but let <hi>Iew,</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> male, or female, poore or rich, bond or free, the learned or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, worke wickedneſſe before the <hi>Lord,</hi> and he ſhalbe without partialitie puniſhed, <hi>Iob</hi> 34.19.</p>
                  <p>Such hath euer beene the practiſe of the <hi>Lord. Lazarus</hi> his pouerty did not hinder him from ſaluation, neither did the <hi>rich</hi> mans abundance free him from damnation. It was no impeachment to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that he was a <hi>Gentile,</hi> nor immunitie to <hi>Iudas,</hi> that he was a <hi>Iew; Saules</hi> throne could not ſhield him from the wrath of God, neither did <hi>Dauids</hi> ſheepfolds avert from him the bleſſings of God; <hi>Eſau</hi> was the elder brother, yet God hated him, <hi>Iacob</hi> was the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, yet God loued him. Neuer did any periſh in <hi>obedience,</hi> neuer did any proſper in <hi>rebellion.</hi> Certainely <hi>God hath no reſpect of any mans perſon,</hi> for his outward eſtate, qualitie, or condition. God ſpared not the <hi>Angels</hi> for their excellencie, nor the <hi>old world</hi> for their multitude; nor <hi>Saul</hi> for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage,

<q>Whoſoeuer doe imitate the Heathen in their impieties, are in the Lords account no better, then the Heathen, and ſhall be puniſhed as the Heathen.</q>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord] Iehovah.</hi> Now the thirteenth time is this great Name of God, <hi>Iehovah,</hi> offered to our deuouteſt meditations. We met with it in the firſt chapter of this book nine times; and thriſe before in this: and yet, by this name <hi>Iehovah,</hi> is not God knowne to vs. We know him by the name of a <hi>ſtrong, omnipotent,</hi> and <hi>All-ſufficient God,</hi> but by his Name, <hi>Iehovah,</hi> we know him not. <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iacob,</hi> by this Name knew him not: it is ſo recorded, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.3. Nor can we by this Name know him. For this Name is a Name of <hi>Eſſence.</hi> It deſigneth God vnto vs, not by any effect of his, but by his <hi>Eſſence:</hi> and who euer knew the <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of God? who was euer able to define it?</p>

The firſt, which is the Philoſophers <hi>Materia prima,</hi> they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1736:196"/> define not <hi>obſummam informitatem,</hi> becauſe it is without all forme: The ſecond, which is mans bane, <hi>Sinne,</hi> they define not <hi>ob ſummam deformitatem,</hi> for its exceeding deformitie: The third, euen <hi>God,</hi> the prime cauſe of all his creatures, they define not <hi>ob ſummam formoſitatem,</hi> for his tranſcende<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t beautie.

                  <p>A <hi>ſinner</hi> ouer-valuing the <hi>vanities</hi> wherein his <hi>delight</hi> is placed, firſt <hi>neglecteth God,</hi> then <hi>hateth</hi> him.

Hee could wiſh, there were no immortality of the Soule, no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be made of our actions, no reward, no reuenge, no Iudge to puniſh. So willing is hee to bathe himſelfe in the imaginary contentment and pleaſures of <hi>ſinne.</hi> I can put no great difference between this <hi>ſinner</hi> and an <hi>Atheiſt.</hi> The <hi>Atheiſt</hi> thinketh, <hi>there is no God;</hi> this <hi>ſinner</hi> wiſheth, <hi>there were no God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>God,</hi> who feeleth the pulſe of this ſinners heart, and ſearcheth his inmoſt thoughts, &amp; ſeeth his traytorous affection, can he be at peace with him? King <hi>Ioram</hi> ſayd to <hi>Iehu,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Is it peace</hi> Iehu? Iehu <hi>anſwered, what
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1736:199"/> peace, ſo long as the whoredomes of thy mother</hi> Iezabel, <hi>and her witch-crafts are ſo many?</hi> This <hi>ſinner</hi> happily will looke to be <hi>at peace</hi> with God: but he is ſoone anſwered, <hi>What haſt thou to doe with peace?</hi> What peace with God doeſt thou looke for, ſo long as thou caſteſt away his feare, and lieſt wallowing in thy <hi>ſinnes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I muſt grant it: <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>God of peace;</hi> the Scripture ſaith it more then once, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.33, and chap. 16.20. and in<note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.9. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.20.</note> other places. But what is this to the <hi>ſinner?</hi> Nothing at all. For the ſame Scripture will aſſure him, <hi>there is no peace to him; Eſai</hi> 48.22. and 57.12. To the ſinner the <hi>Lord</hi> will ſhew himſelfe, <hi>quaſi bellator fortis,</hi> as hee is called, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 20.11. hee will ſhew himſelfe as a <hi>ſtout warriour.</hi> And for ſuch he is deſcribed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.41.

I will make mine arrowes drunk with their blood, and my ſword ſhall deuoure their fleſh?</hi> To like purpoſe is that, which we read of Gods dealing with ſinners, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.12. <hi>He whets his ſword, he bends his bow, and makes it ready, hee prepareth for them the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of death, he ordaineth his arrowes againſt them.</hi> So haue you my doctrine eſtabliſhed,
<q>God is euer in open hoſtility with ſinners.</q>

                  <p>Is God euer <hi>in open hoſtility with ſinners?</hi> Conſider this all yee that <hi>feare God;</hi> remember it all ye, that beare the image of the Almighty.

Let it (Beloued) rouze vs vp from that <hi>ſleepe of ſinne,</hi> wherein we haue too long reſted.

                  <p>OF thoſe grieuous ſinnes, with which the people of Iſrael are in this Chapter charged, two were touched in the former verſe: their <hi>Crueltie,</hi> and their <hi>Couetouſneſſe.

Hitherto may we adde that of <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 7.5. <hi>Let him lay mine honor in the</hi> duſt. <hi>Let him lay mine honor in the</hi> duſt!

All their words, all their deeds
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1736:209"/> are found fault with. Some malicious inuention, or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, is euer at hand to lay the blame vpon them. This I take to be the fitteſt expoſition for this place.</p>
                  <p>Here then we haue the fourth ſinne wherewith the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> are here charged. It is <hi>Caluninia;</hi> their <hi>falſe accuſing of the poore,</hi> a ſinne that euermore attendeth vpon <hi>Oppreſſion.</hi> For the <hi>cruell,</hi> and <hi>couetous</hi> wretch, who is perſwaded that his greatneſſe chiefly conſiſteth in the <hi>oppreſſion of the poore,</hi> will be ſure ſo to prouide, to <hi>keepe the poore vnder,</hi> that they ſhall neuer be able to reuenge the wrongs done vnto them. Let the <hi>poore man</hi> ſlip but vnaduiſedly or ignorantly, the <hi>lawes</hi> muſt by and by take hold on him: whereas the <hi>Rich man,</hi> the <hi>lawes</hi> are but as <hi>Cobwebs:</hi> he breakes throw them all. Hence is that common ſaying: the <hi>poore man doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing well; the rich man nothing ill.</hi> Yea let the <hi>poore man</hi> doe all things well, yet will ſome <hi>rich calumniator</hi> euer be ready, to giue an ill conſtruction of his <hi>beſt wayes;</hi> or, as the phraſe in my text is, <hi>to turne aſide the way of the meeke,</hi> or, <hi>to peruert the way of the poore.</hi> The leſſon which we are to take from hence for our inſtruction is this;
<q>The poore man, which vſeth any honeſt trade or courſe of life, is not to be turned out of his way: his words and actions are not to be miſ-interpreted.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon of this doctrine is plaine in the ſixth verſe of this Chapter: The Lord <hi>will not turne away his puniſhments</hi> from the offenders in this kind; from ſuch, <hi>as turne aſide or peruert, the way of the meeke,</hi> and the <hi>poore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vſe of this doctrine concerneth all thoſe, whom God hath bleſſed with the wealth of this world. It is their dutie not to be careleſſe of the <hi>poore,</hi> not to grieue them, not to hinder them in their honeſt courſes, not <hi>to turne them aſide</hi> out of their <hi>lawfull wayes.</hi> You that haue wherewith to maintaine your ſelues abundantly, you may not exempt your ſelues from doing ſeruice vnto God with your abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. Yea you muſt ſtraine yourſelues to the vttermoſt of your powers to relieue and ſuccour ſuch as are in ſcarcitie, and in want. This is a ſacrifice that God requireth at your
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1736:209"/> hands. Offer it willingly, and you ſhall haue a reward. Your reward it ſhall not be a corruptible Crowne. It ſhall be a Crowne of eternitie. It ſhall be the poſſeſſion of Heauen it ſelfe. The poore ſhall carry you thither.</p>

                  <p>For the remoouing of this ſcruple, that old Canon of an
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1736:212"/> auncient<note n="e" place="margin">Chryſoſtom.</note> Father, will ſerue. <hi>It is proper to the Scripture, to put that for a cauſe, which indeed belongeth to the event. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bera</hi> thus explicats it: It is the manner of the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſometime ſo to ſpeake as if it conſidered onely, what a man doth, and not at all, with what mind he doth it: as if it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered what men doe vulgarly and vſually collect and iudge of any action by the event therof. For the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> many times ſpeaketh as the cuſtome of the common people is.</p>
                  <p>This rule the <hi>Ieſuite</hi>

                     <hi>Pererius</hi> in his Comment vpon <hi>Geneſ.</hi> chap. 43.6. thus plainely deliuereth. <hi>When vpon the deed of any one, any thing falleth out beſides the purpoſe and will of the doer, it is commonly beleeued, and ſaid to be done, as if the doer had of purpoſe willed it.</hi> Will you haue this rule made plaine by examples? Then thus. A man <hi>ſinneth.</hi> His <hi>ſinne</hi> draweth vpon him the <hi>loſſe</hi> &amp; <hi>deſtruction</hi> of his owne ſoule. Now he that <hi>ſinneth</hi> doth not intend any ſuch matter; hee intends not the <hi>loſſe,</hi> or <hi>deſtruction</hi> of his owne ſoule.

                  <p>This <hi>Canon</hi> rightly vnderſtood, much helpeth for the explanation of diuers Scripture places. In<note n="g" place="margin">Hebr. Pſal. <hi>11.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 43.6. the vulgar Interpreter makes <hi>Iſrael</hi> thus to ſpeake to <hi>Iudah,</hi> and other his ſonnes, <hi>In meam hoc feci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis miſeriam, vt indicaretis ei, &amp; alium vos habere fratrem;</hi> you haue done it to my miſerie, that ye told the man, that you had another brother.

                  <p>In 2. <hi>King.</hi> 4.16. the good woman of <hi>Shunem,</hi> that was by <hi>Eliſha</hi> promiſed a ſonne, notwithſtanding her ſelfe was by nature barren, and her husband alſo old, ſaid vnto <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha: Nay my Lord, thou man of God, doe not lie vnto thine handmaide.

Yet becauſe he promiſed, what was not in mans pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to performe, (a ſonne to a woman that was naturally barren, and her husband alſo old) ſome might thinke, that he went about to deceiue the woman.

                  <p>Now let this rule be laid vnto my <hi>text,</hi> and the ſcruple, whereof I but now ſpake, is gone. <hi>A man and his father will goe in vnto the ſame maide to profane my holy name:</hi> they are the words of my <hi>text;</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi> in the mouth of his Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> hath ſpoken them.

                  <p>From hence may you make this Collection: If I may not once <hi>name fornication,</hi> but with <hi>deteſtation,</hi> then may I not <hi>commit it.</hi> If I may not commit <hi>fornication,</hi> much leſſe may I <hi>commit adulterie;</hi> much leſſe <hi>inceſt;</hi> much leſſe <hi>ſome other ſinnes of vncleanneſſe; ſinnes</hi> againſt nature; monſtrous and prodigious <hi>ſinnes.</hi> Now that we may not <hi>commit forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> it is euident by theſe reaſons.</p>

                  </p>

                  <p>IT is a great height of impietie, whereto men are growne, when by vnlawfull meanes, or pretences, or allurements, they <hi>adde ſinne to ſinne.</hi> A man may <hi>ſinne once</hi> and a <hi>ſecond</hi> time; and may doe it through <hi>infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie:</hi> but if he go on with a <hi>third</hi> tranſgreſſion, and with a <hi>fourth;</hi> if he be obſtinate in heaping ſinne vpon ſinne, lamentable is his eſtate. A woe muſt be his portion. Its denounced by the Prophet <hi>Eſay, cap.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Woe vnto them, that draw iniquitie with cords of vanitie, and ſinne, as it were with a cart-rope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Was there euer a people, ſo far giuen ouer to worke im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie? Behold, ſuch were the <hi>people of Iſrael,</hi> they to whom this prophecie of <hi>Amos</hi> was directed. Their <hi>cruelty,</hi> their <hi>couetouſnes,</hi> their <hi>oppreſſions,</hi> their <hi>calumnies,</hi> their <hi>fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy luſts</hi> reproued in the two precedent verſes, do proclaim as much. And yet they haue not done ſinning. They would, I grant, make faire weather; they would make a faire ſhew, as if their deſire were to ſerue God. For that purpoſe they came vnto the <hi>houſe</hi> of their God, his temple; they drew neere vnto his Altars: but euen then did their hearts worke iniquitie. My text conuinceth them.</p>
                  <q>They lay themſelues downe <hi>[or they lye, or they ſit downe]</hi> vpon clothes laid to pledge by euery Altar: and they
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1736:221"/> drinke the wine of the condemned <hi>[or of ſuch as they haue fined, or mulcted]</hi> in the houſe of their Gods.</q>
                  <p>The words import thus much. The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to cloke and couer their manifold ſinnes, make a ſhew of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: they goe vnto their temples, the temples of their Idols; there they offer their ſacrifices, there they feaſt it ſumptuouſly. They are at great charges. But whence doe they defray them? Is it out of their owne ſubſtance, which either is deſcended to them by inheritance, or is gotten by their iuſt and honeſt labour? No ſuch matter. The fines, the mulcts of the poore, their pawnes, their pledges, their pewter, their garments, their bedding, their goods pay for all.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Euen among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> it was a cuſtome long before. Eight hundred years before the incarnation of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the poſteritie of <hi>Iacob</hi> vſed it.

                  <p>Did they <hi>lay themſelues downe vpon clothes?</hi> And why might they not doe ſo? Was not the common cuſtome of ſo doing, a warrant for them ſo to doe? Out of doubt it was.

                     <hi>They lay themſelues downe vpon clothes layd to pledge]</hi> Wee ſhall the better vnderſtand what that ſinne is, which our Prophet here reprooueth in the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> if we will haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Law concerning <hi>pledges.</hi> That <hi>Law</hi> is written, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.26. <hi>If thou at all take thy neighbours raiment to pledge, thou ſhalt deliuer it vnto him by that the Sunne goeth downe:</hi> The Law is repeated, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>When thou lendeſt any thing to</hi> thy neighbour, <hi>thou ſhalt not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his houſe to take his pledge.</hi> But thou ſhalt abide with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:1736:222"/> 
                     <hi>and the man to whom thou lendeſt, ſhall bring the pledge out of the dores vnto thee. And if the man be poore thou ſhalt not ſleepe with his pledge.</hi> But ſhalt <hi>reſtore him the pledge when the Sunne goeth downe.</hi> The ground of this Law is <hi>mercy:</hi> the Law-giuer, is the God of <hi>mercy:</hi> its giuen, to ſtirre vs vp to <hi>mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If at all thou take thy neighbours raiment to pledge, thou muſt deliuer it vnto him by the going downe of the Sunne.</hi> That is the Law. Thereof, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.27. haue you two reaſons: One is taken from common humanitie. The poore mans <hi>rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!</hi> It is his <hi>onely couering; It is his raiment for his skinne.</hi> Take that from him, and <hi>wherein ſhall he ſleepe? Reſtore</hi> therefore his <hi>pledge before the Sunne goeth downe.</hi> The other reaſon is taken from the iudgement of God. If the poore man <hi>crie,</hi> God will <hi>heare</hi> him, for he is <hi>gracious. Reſtore</hi> thou therefore his <hi>pledge before the Sunne goeth downe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the 24. of <hi>Deut. ver.</hi> 13. three reaſons are brought to the ſame purpoſe. The poore mans <hi>pledge;</hi> See that <hi>in any caſe</hi> thou <hi>deliuer it, when the Sunne goeth downe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, that <hi>he may ſleepe in his owne raiment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that <hi>he may bleſſe thee,</hi> may pray for thee, may teſtifie vnto God the ſence and feeling he hath of thy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, and kind dealing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that <hi>it may be righteouſneſſe vnto thee,</hi> euen <hi>before the Lord thy God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>See therefore, that <hi>in any caſe</hi> thou <hi>reſtore</hi> the poore mans <hi>pledge, when the Sunne goeth downe.</hi> You haue the <hi>law,</hi> and the <hi>reaſons</hi> of the Law.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Law</hi> theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> violated. <hi>They tooke to pledge poore mens clothes,</hi> they deteined them, they vſed them, they <hi>lay vpon them,</hi> as if they had beene their owne. The ſinne then here laid vnto their charge, is <hi>Detentio pignoris paupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> the keeping backe of the poore mans <hi>pledge.</hi> The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which we may take from hence, is this,
<q>The pledge of a poore man, ſuch as is neceſſarie for his vſe, is not to be withholden from him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay, ſuch as is neceſſarie for his vſe. <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:1736:223"/> places of <hi>Exodus</hi> and <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> makes mention of his <hi>raiment.</hi> The <hi>raiment</hi> of the poore man! it is <hi>operi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> his couering; it is <hi>veſtimentum,</hi> his clothing: he hath nothing elſe, wherewith to hide his nakedneſſe: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, wherewith to ſaue himſelfe from cold. Such a <hi>pledge,</hi> as is the poore mans <hi>raiment,</hi> his <hi>coat,</hi> his <hi>dublet,</hi> his <hi>bed,</hi> his <hi>couering,</hi> or any other thing, that is <hi>neceſſarie for the preſeruing of his life,</hi> God will haue it <hi>reſtored.</hi> Yet it will pleaſe him well, if <hi>ſuch a pledge be neuer taken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Law runnes thus in the 22. of <hi>Exodus. If at all thou take thy neighbours raiment to pledge, thou muſt deliuer it vnto him by the going downe of the Sunne.</hi> It is as if the <hi>Lord</hi> had thus ſaid: I ſhall like it well, if thou <hi>lend</hi> vnto thy poore neighbour <hi>without taking any pledge of him;</hi> but if thou be ſo cruell, and hard hearted, as that thou wilt not be induced to <hi>lend</hi> without taking of a pawne, yet ſee in any caſe, that <hi>thou reſtore vnto him his pawne before the Sunne goeth downe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lords deſire to haue no <hi>pawne</hi> at all taken of the poore man, is more plainely manifeſted, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.6. The Law there is: <hi>No man ſhall take the two mil-ſtones, or the vpper mil-ſtone to pledge.</hi> Mention is made firſt of <hi>two milſtones,</hi> and then of the <hi>vppermoſt.</hi> It is all one as if the <hi>Lord</hi> had ſayd: <hi>You ſhall not take to pledge both milſtones, no nor one of them.</hi> As good take <hi>both,</hi> as <hi>one.</hi> There is no grinding without <hi>both.</hi> If thou take <hi>one</hi> and leaue the <hi>other,</hi> how ſhall the poore man <hi>grind? Milſtones</hi> are named: vnder them by a <hi>Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche</hi> you may comprehend all kind of vtenſils, or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with which a poore man gets his liuing. In this ranke I place the Husbandmans plow, the Smithes anvill, the Taylors ſheares, and euery other handy-crafts mans toole, which is neceſſarie for the exerciſe of his trade or occupation. <hi>None ſuch</hi> may you take to <hi>pawne. Moſes</hi> adde the reaſon: For, he that takes ſuch a pawne of a poore man, <hi>takes the poore mans life to pawne.</hi>

                  <p>Say; thou <hi>lendeſt</hi> a poore man <hi>thy money,</hi> and he buyeth bread therewith, &amp; eateth; and in the meane time through want of his <hi>raiment,</hi> which thou haſt to <hi>pawne,</hi> the poore man be <hi>frozen to death:</hi> how haſt thou relieued him?

                  <p>THis is the laſt branch in the enumeration of the ſinnes of the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> It concerneth the Iudges of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Rulers of that ſtate; them prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally. It is appliable to others alſo, to the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſort. The words are a reproofe of the groſſe ſuperſtition of that people. They thought their dutie touching the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, well diſcharged, ſo they repaired to their <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> Such holy places they thought were of themſelues ſufficient to clenſe them, albeit they ſhould euen there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelues to inordinate <hi>eating,</hi> to vnmeaſurable <hi>drinking,</hi> to infamous <hi>luxurie,</hi> yea, to euery kinde of <hi>villanie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For my more plaine proceeding in the handling of the words of this text, will you be pleaſed to note in them,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the action, for which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are here repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; it is a <hi>drinking</hi> of <hi>wine. They drinke wine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>whoſe wine</hi> it is, they drinke. Its not their owne; its <hi>vinum damnatorum;</hi> it's the wine of the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. <hi>They drinke the wine of the condemned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>where</hi> they drinke it. They drinke it not at home, which were more tolerable; but <hi>in domo deorum ſuorum,</hi> in the houſe of their Gods. <hi>They drinke the wine of the condemned in the houſe of their Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt convinceth them of <hi>riot,</hi> and <hi>exceſſe. They drinke wine</hi> immoderately. They are ſo giuen to it, that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1736:230"/> they abſteine not euen then, when they are in their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and would ſeeme moſt religious. For they <hi>drinke</hi> it <hi>in the houſe of their Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond convinceth them of <hi>oppreſſion.</hi> The wine they drinke, is <hi>vinum damnatorum;</hi> it is the wine of the condemned: it is <hi>vinum mulctatorum,</hi> the <hi>wine</hi> of ſuch as they haue <hi>fined</hi> or <hi>mulcted: wine,</hi> bought with the money of them, whom they haue in their vnrighteous iudgments ſpoyled of their goods.</p>
                  <p>The third conuinceth them of <hi>idolatry.</hi> They drinke their wine in the houſe of <hi>their Gods;</hi> not in the <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> that once glorious <hi>Temple</hi> of the true and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, but in the temple of <hi>their gods,</hi> in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi> and other places, before their <hi>golden calues</hi> and other their <hi>Idols. They drinke the wine of the condemned in the houſe of their Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>They drinke wine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wine!</hi> Why might they not? Is it not one of the <hi>good</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt his miraculous turning of <hi>water</hi> into <hi>wine</hi> at the marriage of <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee, Ioh.</hi> 2.11. is euidence enough that he allowed the <hi>drinking</hi> of <hi>wine.</hi> Yea, himſelfe <hi>dranke wine.</hi> Elſe the people would neuer haue called him a <hi>wine-bibber,</hi> as it appeareth they did, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.19. <hi>S Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.23. wiſheth <hi>Timothie</hi> no longer to <hi>drinke water,</hi> but <hi>to vſe a little wine for his ſtomackes ſake.</hi> Wine hath its praiſes in the Scripture. It <hi>makes glad the heart of man, Pſal.</hi> 104.15. It <hi>cheareth God and man, Iudg.</hi> 9.13.</p>
                  <p>How then is it, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are here reproued for <hi>drinking wine?</hi> I anſwer, not for <hi>drinking wine,</hi> but for the <hi>abuſe in drinking</hi> are the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> here reproued. It is with <hi>wine,</hi> as it is with euery other good <hi>creature</hi> of God. It may

Paul</hi> deſirous either to preuent, or to reforme in the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> thus ſpeaketh to the <hi>Epheſians, chap.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Be yee not drunke with wine, wherein is exceſſe.</hi> It is as if he had ſaid: <hi>Take heed of wine;</hi> be not ouercome of it. <hi>In vino luxus.</hi> Conſider the man that is giuen ouer to <hi>drunkenneſſe.</hi> His life its profuſe, its diſſolute, its vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, its luxurious, its vnworthy a Chriſtian. <hi>Take heed of wine.</hi>

                  <q>God pleadeth the cauſe of the poore, againſt their oppreſſors.</q>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:1736:234"/>
                  <p>The leſſe neede haue I now to ſpend my time vpon it. Yet a word of it. My now-doctrine I deliuer in this poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
<q>It is not lawfull for any man to oppreſſe another.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> I call euery <hi>iniuſtice,</hi> vſed of the mightier, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by violence, or by colour of law, or by any other cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning dealing, againſt ſuch as are not able to withſtand them.</p>
                  <p>This deſcription of oppreſſion, I gather from <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.14. from <hi>Micah</hi> 2.1, 2. and from 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.6. In ech place the vnlawfulneſſe of oppreſſion is manifeſted.</p>
                  <p>The firſt place is, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.14. The commandement there is: <hi>If thou ſell ought vnto thy neighbour, or buyeſt ought of thy neighbors hand, yee ſhall not oppreſſe one another.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you <hi>ſell</hi> or <hi>buy,</hi> you may not <hi>oppreſſe:</hi> the very forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> is a ſufficient argument, that <hi>oppreſſion</hi> is vnlawfull.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond place is, <hi>Micah</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Woe to them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe iniquitie, and worke euill vpon their beds: when the morning is light, they practiſe it, becauſe it is in the power of their hands. And they couet fields, and take them by violence; and houſes, and take them away. So they oppreſſe a man and his houſe, euen a man and his heritage.</hi> where you haue an imprecation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>oppreſſors,</hi> a <hi>woe</hi> thundred out againſt them. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to proue <hi>oppreſſion</hi> to be vnlawfull.</p>
                  <p>The third place is, 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.6. <hi>This is the will of God, that no man oppreſſe, or ouer-reach his brother in any matter.</hi> Is it <hi>Gods will?</hi> Then ſurely it is not lawfull for you to <hi>oppreſſe</hi> or <hi>ouer-reach</hi> one another in any buſineſſe. Men of trade may not gaine by their falſe <hi>weights,</hi> falſe <hi>meaſures,</hi> falſe <hi>ſpeeches,</hi> or <hi>falſe oathes;</hi> neither may men in any other courſe of life gaine by <hi>violence,</hi> or by <hi>colour of Law,</hi> or by any other <hi>cunning dealing.</hi> Thus is my doctrine confirmed,
<q>It is not lawfull for any man to oppreſſe another.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, it may ſerue for a reproofe of the <hi>Oppreſſors</hi> of this age, who make <hi>gold</hi> their <hi>hope,</hi> and the <hi>wedge of gold</hi> their <hi>confidence,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>chap.</hi> 31.24. <hi>S. Paul,</hi> he taught, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.6. that <hi>Godlineſſe is great gaine:</hi> but theſe men ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1736:234"/> the contrary, that <hi>gaine</hi> is great godlineſſe: and therefore they feare not to <hi>gaine</hi> with the hurt of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>They build their <hi>houſes, as the moth.</hi> So ſaith <hi>Iob, chap.</hi> 27.18. As the <hi>moth!</hi> How is that? The <hi>moth</hi> is made full by ſpoyling the barkes, and bookes wherein it liueth. So is it with theſe men; they make themſelues full, by ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling others, with whom they liue, and haue to deale. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it in <hi>Ieremies</hi> phraſe, <hi>chap.</hi> 22.13. They <hi>build</hi> their houſes <hi>by vnrighteouſnes,</hi> and their <hi>chambers by wrong:</hi> and in <hi>Habakkuks</hi> phraſe, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.12. They <hi>build</hi> them townes <hi>with blood,</hi> and <hi>ſtabliſh</hi> their Cities <hi>by iniquitie.</hi> Againſt theſe is that complaint of the Lord, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>Ye haue eaten vp the vineyard; the ſpoyle of the poore is in your houſes. What meane yee, that yee beat my people to peeces, and grinde the faces of the poore? Woe</hi> to theſe men; a <hi>woe</hi> from <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah,</hi> a <hi>woe</hi> from <hi>Ieremie,</hi> a <hi>woe</hi> from <hi>Habakkuk</hi> in the now-alleaged places; a <hi>woe</hi> from <hi>Eſay</hi> too, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Woe</hi> vpon <hi>woe</hi> and yet will they not ceaſe from ioyning <hi>houſe to houſe,</hi> and laying <hi>land to land,</hi> as if the way to the ſpirituall <hi>Canaan</hi> were all by <hi>Land,</hi> and not through <hi>a red Sea of death,</hi> as one wittily ſpeaketh.</p>
                  <p>From this contempt of the Prophets of the <hi>Lord,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelfe ſpeaking by his Prophets, it is now come to paſſe, that many a poore tenant is <hi>thruſt out of his houſe;</hi> that Villages are <hi>depopulated,</hi> that thoſe ſtreets which were wont to be ſowen with the ſeeds of men, are now become paſtures for the <hi>ſending forth of oxen,</hi> and for <hi>the treading of ſheepe,</hi> as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>chap.</hi> 7.25.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus haue you the firſt vſe of my doctrine. My
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1736:235"/> doctrine was, <hi>It is not lawfull for any man to oppreſſe another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vſe was a generall reproofe of our <hi>now-oppreſſors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſecond vſe may be to admoniſh <hi>Iudges, Iuſtices,</hi> and other <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Rulers,</hi> that they ſuffer not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be ſtained with this ſin of <hi>oppreſſion.</hi> It is the<note n="o" place="margin">Pilkinton ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit. in Nehem. cap. <hi>5.</hi> fol. <hi>80.

                  <p>This dutie is laid vpon him, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 21.12. There thus ſaith the <hi>Lord</hi> to the houſe of <hi>Dauid: Execute iudgem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, Gods commandement is, that Magiſtrates ſhould <hi>ſeeke iudgement.</hi> Muſt they <hi>ſeeke iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> Therefore in caſes of <hi>oppreſſion</hi> they are not to ſtay till they be called for. Thirdly, God commendeth vnto Magiſtrates, all that are <hi>oppreſſed,</hi> but ſpecially the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe</hi> and <hi>widow:</hi> the <hi>fatherleſſe,</hi> becauſe they want the defence of their parents; and the <hi>widow,</hi> becauſe ſhe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of the helpe of her husband; and we know, euery man goeth ouer, where the hedge is loweſt. Therefore are Magiſtrates to take vpon them the defence of the <hi>father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,</hi> the defence of the <hi>widow,</hi> the defence of <hi>euery one, that is oppreſſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it ſo? Then are Magiſtrates to take ſpeciall heed, that themſelues be neither principalls, nor acceſſaries, in the ſin of <hi>Oppreſſion.</hi> They muſt abhor the practiſe of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Ieruſalem, who <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.23. are ſtiled <hi>companions of theeues,</hi> becauſe they <hi>loued gifts,</hi> and <hi>followed after rewards.</hi> They are to deteſt the corruption of the rulers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.18. loue <hi>with ſhame</hi> to cry, <hi>Bring yee, Bring yee.</hi> They muſt hate the wayes of <hi>Samuels</hi> ſonnes, who 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.3. <hi>turned aſide after lucre, tooke bribes, and peruerted iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:1736:236"/> They muſt loath the courſes of curſed <hi>Balaam,</hi> who 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Loued the wages of vnrighteouſneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Happy is the land that is ruled by ſuch Magiſtrates. Such may with boldnes ſtand vp, and make proteſtation with iuſt and vncorrupt <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Behold, here</hi> we are; <hi>witneſſe againſt</hi> vs: <hi>whoſe oxe haue</hi> we <hi>taken? whom haue</hi> we <hi>defrauded? whom haue</hi> we <hi>oppreſſed? of whoſe hand haue</hi> we <hi>receiued any bribes to blinde our eyes therewith?</hi> and no man ſhall be able to accuſe them.</p>
                  <p>Are ours ſuch? I ſtand not here to plead againſt them. Onely this I ſay: If ours be not ſuch, but are of another ſtampe: if they <hi>loue the wages of vnrighteouſneſſe,</hi> if they <hi>loue gifts,</hi> if they <hi>follow after rewards,</hi> if they <hi>turne aſide after lucre,</hi> if they <hi>take bribes,</hi> if they ſhame not to cry, <hi>Bring ye, bring yee;</hi> I may ranke them with theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in my text: They will <hi>ſell the righteous for ſiluer;</hi> they will <hi>ſell the poore for a paire of ſhoes;</hi> they will <hi>pant after the duſt of the earth on the head of the poore;</hi> they will <hi>turne aſide the way of the meeke,</hi> and they will <hi>drinke the wine of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus haue you the ſecond vſe of my doctrine. My do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was, <hi>It is not lawfull for any man to oppreſſe another.</hi> The vſe was an admonition to <hi>Magiſtrates, rulers,</hi> and other <hi>officers,</hi> that they ſuffer not themſelues to be ſtained with the ſinne of <hi>oppreſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third vſe followeth. It reacheth to the <hi>poore oppreſſed.</hi> They may from hence receiue conſolation; from hence they may be comforted. Is it not an exceeding great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to a <hi>poore oppreſſed</hi> wretch, to know, that God taketh notice of the oppreſſions, vnder which he groaneth? That God doth ſo, I haue already made it manifeſt in the proofe of my doctrine, in the reproofe of <hi>oppreſſors,</hi> and in the Magiſtrates admonition. It is cleare alſo in the letter of my text. Here God taketh notice of the <hi>oppreſſions</hi> of the <hi>poore</hi> in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in as much as the Iudges, the Rulers, and great men there did <hi>drinke the wine of the condemned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereto I adde that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.5. <hi>For the oppreſſion of the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1736:236"/> poore, for the ſighing of the needie, now will I ariſe (ſaith the Lord) I will ſet him in ſafetie from him that puffeth at him,</hi> from him that would enſnare him. Behold here, firſt <hi>Gods readineſſe to helpe the poore,</hi> and ſecondly, <hi>how forcible with God the poore mans prayers are.</hi> Are not both theſe to a <hi>poore oppreſſed</hi> man points of ſingular comfort? Out of doubt they are.</p>
                  <p>But ſome <hi>poore man</hi> preſſed downe with the burden of oppreſſion, may here ſay vnto me. Hath God promiſed <hi>to deliuer me from mine oppreſſors?</hi> Why then am I ſtill oppreſſed?</p>
                  <p>Stay a while, and thou ſhalt behold the goodnes of the Lord. Its not for thee to make haſte, or to ſeeke by vile, and vnwarrantable courſes to winde thy ſelfe out of thine oppreſſors hands. Vntill it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to put an end to thy preſent grieuances, its thy dutie to poſſeſſe thy ſoule in patience. Preſcribe not thou vnto the Lord, what he ſhall doe. Let his <hi>grace,</hi> let his <hi>fauour</hi> be ſufficient for thee, whatſoeuer it bring with it; be it want, or pouertie, or aduerſitie. One drop of his <hi>fauour</hi> is better worth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and more of valew, then this whole world. If thou haue but a taſt, but a touch of it, it will make thee ſing with <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 119.71. <hi>Its good for me that I haue bin afflicted: good,</hi> that I haue bin in want, in pouertie, in aduerſitie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the griping hand of the <hi>oppreſſor.</hi> O! how ſweet is the quiet <hi>fruit</hi> of <hi>righteouſnes,</hi> that ſpringeth forth from the bitter <hi>roote</hi> of <hi>tribulation!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I haue done with the <hi>poore oppreſſed,</hi> when I ſhall haue giuen them a <hi>Caveat.</hi> The <hi>Caveat</hi> is, that <hi>they themſelues oppreſſe not themſelues.</hi> There is no <hi>oppreſſion</hi> to the <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,</hi> that one <hi>poore man</hi> exerciſeth towards another. For <hi>a poore man that oppreſſeth the poore, is like a ſweeping raine, that leaues no foode. Salomon</hi> avoweth it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.3. <hi>A poore man]</hi> a man of meane eſtate, <hi>if he oppreſſe]</hi> by force, by fraud, by bargaining, or otherwiſe, <hi>a poore man]</hi> ſuch as he himſelfe is, whom he ſhould tender and pitie, becauſe
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1736:237"/> by him he may be put in minde of his owne eſtate, <hi>he is like a ſweeping raine]</hi> like a floud that riſeth through abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of raine, or he is like a great ſtorme and tempeſt of raine, that ſuddenly carieth away corne, hay, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it meeteth with, and <hi>leaues behinde it no foode</hi> for men or cattle to liue on. <hi>A poore man if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a ſweeping raine, that leaues no foode.</hi>

<q>
                        <pb n="200" facs="tcp:1736:238"/>Goods gotten vnlawfully are not fit to be employed in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God. No, nor in the ſeruice of Idols.</q>

Ridiculous!</hi> And will you thinke a <hi>ridiculous offering</hi> fit for Gods ſeruice? In the 20. verſ. of the ſame Chapter <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> ſaith further: <hi>Who ſo bringeth an offering of the goods of the poore, doth as one that killeth the ſonne before the fathers eyes.</hi> Can a <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> be pleaſed to haue his <hi>ſonne</hi> ſlaine before his eyes? You will ſay, no. No more will it be pleaſing to God to haue <hi>an offering of ill gotten goods</hi> preſented to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Salomon</hi> Prov. 15.8. ſaith, <hi>The ſacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord.</hi> He ſaith it againe, <hi>chap.</hi> 21.27. <hi>The ſacrifice of the wicked is an abomination.</hi> Its true. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer <hi>Sacrifice</hi> the <hi>wicked man offereth to the Lord,</hi> be it offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red neuer ſo ſolemnly, neuer ſo ſumptuouſly, it will be an <hi>abomination to the Lord,</hi> the Lord will abhor it, he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it. Much more will he abhor and deteſt any offering that ſhall be made of <hi>goods ill gotten,</hi> of the goods of the poore. Of ſuch ſacrificers he ſaith in <hi>Eſay, chap.</hi> 66.3. <hi>He that killeth an oxe, is as if he ſlue a man: he that ſacrificeth a lambe,</hi> as <hi>he that cut off a dogs neck, he that offereth an oblation,</hi> as if <hi>he offered ſwines fleſh, he that burneth incenſe,</hi> as if he <hi>bleſſed an Idol.</hi>

                  <q>Goods gotten vnlawfully are not fit to be employed in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God.</q>
                  <p>But may they be employed <hi>in the ſeruice of Idols? No,</hi> they may not.

This is the very reaſon why our Prophet here reproueth the Iſraelites for bringing into the Temples of their Idols, their ill-gotten goods, <hi>the wine of the condemned.</hi> They thought thereby to do ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, not ſo much to their <hi>Idols,</hi> as to the great <hi>God</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, whom by their Idols they repreſented. Thus haue you my whole doctrine eſtabliſhed,
<q>Goods gotten vnlawfully are not fit to be employed in the ſeruice of God: No, nor in the ſeruice of Idols.</q>

                        <p>And I raiſed vp of your ſonnes for Prophets, and of your yong men for <hi>Nazarites.</hi> Is it not euen thus, O yee children of Iſrael, ſaith the Lord?</p>

                  <p>MY meditations haue beene heretofore fiue times exerciſed in diſcourſing vnto you of the <hi>ſinnes,</hi> wherewith the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the precedent verſes ſtand charged. Their ſinnes were, <hi>Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, Crueltie, Oppreſſion, Falſe dealing, Filthie luſts, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt, Idolatrie, Riot,</hi> and <hi>Exceſſe.</hi> Groſſe and palpable enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. My endeuour was by <hi>the ſword of the Spirit,</hi> the word of God, to arme you againſt them, that yee giue them no paſſage, no not a little; that yee ſuffer them not by any meanes to haue dominion ouer you.</p>
                  <p>From their <hi>ſinnes</hi> we come to their <hi>Bleſſings;</hi> thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings wherewith God had bleſſed them. Foure are heere mentioned.</p>
                  <p>One is, the <hi>ruine of the Amorites,</hi> ſet downe verſe 9. <hi>Yet deſtroyed I the</hi> Amorite <hi>before them, whoſe height was like the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:1736:240"/> height of the</hi> Cedars, <hi>and he was ſtrong as the</hi> Okes, <hi>yet I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed his fruit from aboue, and his rootes from beneath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, <hi>their deliuerance from the ſeruitude of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt. ver. 10. <hi>Alſo I brought you vp from the land of</hi> Egypt.</p>
                  <p>The third is, <hi>their ſafe paſſage through the deſert,</hi> touched in the ſame verſe; <hi>I led you fortie yeares through the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> And why ſo? but, <hi>to poſſeſſe the land of the</hi> Amorite.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were three great bleſſings; yet were they but tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall. The fourth paſſeth; It is ſpirituall, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>I rayſed vp of your ſonnes for Prophets, and of your young men for</hi> Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.</p>
                  <p>The confirmation of all followeth in the ſame verſe: <hi>Is it not euen thus, O yee children of Iſrael, ſayth the Lord?</hi> Say O yee children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> Haue I not done ſo and ſo for you? Haue I not deſtroyed the <hi>Amorite</hi> for your ſake? Haue I not freed you from your <hi>Egyptian</hi> yoke? Haue I not guided you through <hi>the deſert?</hi> Haue I not giuen you <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Nazarites</hi> of your owne <hi>ſonnes,</hi> and of your owne <hi>yong men</hi> for your inſtruction in the true ſeruice and worſhip of your God? <hi>Is it euen thus, O yee children of Iſrael, ſaith the Lord?</hi>

                  <p>You haue now the ſcope of my Prophet, and the ſumme of this Scripture. My preſent diſcourſe muſt begin with the firſt mentioned benefit beſtowed by God vpon that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. It is the <hi>ruine of the Amorites</hi> for their ſake, thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Yet deſtroyed I the</hi> Amorite <hi>before them, &amp;c.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond hath a deſcription of that people. They are deſcribed, from their <hi>ſtature,</hi> and from their <hi>valour.</hi> Each is ſet forth vnto vs by way of compariſon: their ſtature or tallneſſe by the <hi>Cedar,</hi> their valour or ſtrength by the <hi>Oke; Their height was like the height of the</hi> Cedars, <hi>and hee was ſtrong as the</hi> Okes.</p>
                  <p>The third hath a particular explication or amplification of their ruine; It was not any gentle ſtripe that they recei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued, not any light inciſion, not any ſmall wound; but it
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:1736:240"/> was their extermination, their contrition, their vniuerſall ouerthrow, their vtter ruine.

                  <p>Of the firſt of theſe three parts at this time. It hath a generall touch of the <hi>ruine of the</hi> Amorites. <hi>Yet I deſtroyed the</hi> Amorite <hi>before them.</hi>

                  <p>The Ieſuite <hi>Pererius</hi> in his third <hi>Tome</hi> of Commentaries vpon <hi>Geneſis,</hi> writing vpon the 15. Chapter, ver. 16. theſe words, <hi>The iniquitie of the</hi> Amorite <hi>is not yet full,</hi> moues this very doubt, but thus: The reader may here wonder, why mention is made onely of <hi>one Nation</hi> of the <hi>Amorite,</hi> ſith it
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:1736:246"/> is plaine by other places of holy Scripture, that there were <hi>ſeauen Nations,</hi> which the <hi>Lord</hi> draue out from before the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His firſt anſwere is: It may by a <hi>Synecdoche.</hi> A part may be put for the whole; one Nation of the <hi>Amorites</hi> for all the ſeauen. A like <hi>Synecdoche</hi> there is, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 1.4. There thus ſayth the <hi>Lord</hi> vnto <hi>Ioſhuah: From the wilderneſſe and this Lebanon, euen vnto the great riuer, the riuer</hi> Euphrates, <hi>all the land of the</hi> Hittites, <hi>and vnto the great Sea, toward the going downe of the Sunne, ſhall be your coaſt.</hi> All the land of the <hi>Hittites,</hi> ſhall be your coaſt; The <hi>Hittites</hi> onely are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and yet within the bounds deſcribed all the <hi>ſeauen</hi> had their habitations. It is therefore a <hi>Synecdoche.</hi> A part is put for the whole: <hi>One Nation</hi> of the <hi>Hittites</hi> for all the <hi>ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi> Its ſo here: <hi>One Nation</hi> of the <hi>Amorites</hi> for all the <hi>ſeauen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This anſwere admitting a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> is approued by <hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator, Tremellius,</hi> and <hi>Iunius.</hi> Yet <hi>Pererius</hi> thinkes to giue a better. And therefore his ſecond anſwere is: that the <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi> are <hi>praecipuè &amp; ſingulariter,</hi> chiefly and principally, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med aboue all the reſt, and for them all; becauſe for the largeneſſe of their Nation, and for their height of ſtature, and for their ſtrength of bodie, and for their exceſſiue cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, and impietie, they were aboue all, famous and much ſpoken of.</p>

                  <p>For further proofe hereof we may haue recourſe to the 15. chapter of the Booke of <hi>Exodus.</hi> There <hi>Moſes</hi> ſings a ſong vnto the <hi>Lord,</hi> a ſong of thankeſgiuing, wherein hee acknowledgeth the <hi>Lord</hi> to be all in all, in the ouerthrow of his enemies, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſt in the red Sea. His acknowledgment is, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Thy right hand, O Lord, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come glorious in power: thy right hand, O Lord, hath daſhed in peices the enemie: In the greatneſſe of thine excellencie, thou haſt ouerthrowne them: thou ſenteſt forth thy wrath, which hath conſumed them as ſtubble.

                  <p>OF the benefits here mentioned to haue beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed by God vpon his people, the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the firſt place we haue the ouerthrow of the <hi>Amorites.</hi> It is deliuered, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. Therein I propounded to your religious attentions three principall parts.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt, we haue the ouerthrow of the <hi>Amorites; Yet deſtroyed I the</hi> Amorite <hi>before them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſecond, the <hi>Amorites</hi> are deſcribed. Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription is taken from their <hi>ſtature,</hi> and from their <hi>valour,</hi> each is ſet forth vnto vs by way of Compariſon: their <hi>ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> or height by the <hi>Cedars;</hi> their <hi>valour</hi> or ſtrength by the <hi>Oke. Their height was like the height of the</hi> Cedars, <hi>and he was ſtrong as the</hi> Okes.</p>
                  <p>The third hath an explication, or an amplification of the ouerthrow of the <hi>Amorites.</hi> It was not any gentle ſtripe that they receiued, not any light inciſion, not any ſmall wound; but it was their extermination, their contrition, their vniuerſall ouerthrow, their vtter ruine. <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>roote,</hi> Prince and people, Parents and children, old &amp; yong, were all brought to nought: <hi>Yet deſtroyed I their fruit from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, and their roote from beneath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:1736:249"/>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe three principall parts, deliuering in a generalitie the ouerthrow of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> was the ſubiect of my laſt diſcourſe out of this place. Now followeth the ſecond: the deſcription of that people, the people of the <hi>Amorites.</hi> They are for their height or <hi>ſtature</hi> compared to the <hi>Cedars,</hi> and for their ſtrength and <hi>valour</hi> to the <hi>Okes. Their height was like the height of the</hi> Cedars, <hi>&amp; he was ſtrong as the</hi> Okes.</p>
                  <q>Their height was like the height of the <hi>Cedars.</hi>

                  <p>IN <hi>Syria,</hi> and eſpecially in mount <hi>Lebanon,</hi> the <hi>Cedar</hi> trees grew very high. <hi>Sennacherib</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> by his meſſage to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> giueth teſtimonie hereunto. His meſſage is, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 19.23. <hi>With the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of my chariots, I am come vp to the height of the</hi> moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, <hi>to the ſides of Lebanon, and will cut downe the tall</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars <hi>thereof. Succidam altitudinem Cedrorum eius,</hi> ſo he ſpeaketh in the <hi>Hebrew, I will cut downe the tallneſſe of the</hi> Cedars <hi>of</hi> Lebanon.

To proue it, he bringeth thoſe words of the ſpouſe concerning her Beloued, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.15. <hi>His countenance is
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:1736:250"/> as</hi> Lebanon, <hi>excellent as the</hi> Cedars: that is, his Heroicall proceritie and the maieſtie of his countenance is like vnto the <hi>Cedars</hi> of <hi>Lebanon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Spouſe thus comparing the countenance of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, to mount <hi>Lebanon</hi> and the <hi>Cedars</hi> there, intimateth, that the encreaſe of the knowledge of God and his worſhip ſhall be ſo great, as that the open profeſſion of Chriſt, for its durableneſſe &amp; ſtabilitie, may well be likened to moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines: and that the <hi>Cedars</hi> of <hi>Lebanon</hi> doe not ſo much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uergrow other trees in tallneſſe; as true Chriſtian religion for its reuerend maieſtie ſhall ouergoe whatſoeuer blind, buſhie, and thornie ſuperſtitions.</p>
                  <p>It is out of doubt. <hi>Cedar</hi> trees are verie high. So high, that neuer man, neuer Gyant was ſo high. How then is it, that my text thus ſpeaketh of the <hi>Amorites, Their height was like the height of the</hi> Cedars?</p>
                  <p>It is by a figure, which the <hi>Greekes</hi> call <hi>Hyperbole.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many inſtances may be alledged out of holy Scripture. In the 2. of <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.23. it is ſaid of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan, They were ſwifter then Eagles, they were ſtronger then Lyons.</hi> Swifter then <hi>Eagles,</hi> and yet the <hi>Eagle</hi> of birds is the ſwif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt; ſtronger then <hi>Lyons,</hi> and yet the <hi>Lyon</hi> of Beaſts is the ſtrongeſt. They were <hi>ſwifter then Eagles,</hi> they were <hi>ſtronger then Lyons:</hi> they are two <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> or prouerbiall ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. By them the holy Ghoſt lets vs vnderſtand, that <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan,</hi> were exceeding ſwift of foot, and ſtrong of bodie.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Pſalme</hi> 107.26. it is ſayd of the waues of the Sea in a great tempeſt; <hi>They mount vp to Heauen, they goe downe againe to the depths.</hi> They are two <hi>Hyperboles.</hi> By them the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſetteth as it were before our eyes, the greatneſſe of the daunger, wherein they often times are, that trade by Sea.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 13.16. The Lord ſaid to <hi>Abram, I will make thy ſeede as the duſt of the earth: ſo that if a man can number the duſt of the earth, then ſhall thy ſeed alſo be numbred.</hi> I will make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>I paſſe ouer with ſilence, many inſtances of like nature, and returne to my text, where it is ſaid of the <hi>Amorites, Their height was like the height of the Cedars.</hi> The ſpeach is prouerbiall, its hyperbolicall. We may not from it col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that the <hi>Amorites</hi> were as high as the <hi>Cedars,</hi> but this onely that the <hi>Amorites</hi> were a people very tall and high of ſtature. Neuer did any man equall the <hi>Cedars</hi> in height: yet ſhew me a man, that is of a vaſte bodie, and of an vnuſuall proceritie, I may take vp this Scripture phraſe, and ſay of him; <hi>His height is like the height of Cedars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the <hi>Amorites</hi> for their <hi>height</hi> or talnes are likened to the <hi>Cedar.</hi> For their ſtrength or <hi>valour</hi> they are reſembled to the <hi>Oke,</hi> in the next words:
<q>He was ſtrong as the Okes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The figure of ſpeach is, as before. Its prouerbiall. The <hi>Oke</hi> you know, is a hard kinde of wood, ſtrong, firme, and durable. Hence is the prouerbe, <hi>Quercu robuſtior,</hi> or <hi>robore validior,</hi> ſtronger then the <hi>Oke.</hi> Neuer was there man of ſo firme a conſtitution, that he can properly be ſaid to be ſtronger then the <hi>Oke:</hi> Yet ſhew me a man of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie ſtrength, I may take vp this Scripture-phraſe, and ſay of him, <hi>Fortis ipſe quaſi quercus,</hi> he is ſtrong as the <hi>Okes.</hi> And in this ſenſe it is here ſaid of the <hi>Amorite,</hi> He was ſtrong as the <hi>Okes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Amorites</hi> were of an vnuſuall and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <hi>height</hi> and <hi>ſtrength,</hi> as they are here deſcribed by our

Their relation is, <hi>Num.</hi> 13.28. <hi>The people be ſtrong that dwell in the land; we ſaw the children of</hi> Anak <hi>there.</hi> At the 32. verſe they ſpeake more fully: <hi>All the people, that we ſaw in it, are men of great ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And there we ſaw the Gyants, the ſonnes of</hi> Anak, <hi>which come of the Gyants, and we were in our owne ſight, as graſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and ſo were we in their ſight.</hi> By this relation of the <hi>Spies</hi> you ſee, that the <hi>Amorites,</hi> the inhabitants of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> were more, then ordinarie <hi>tall</hi> and <hi>ſtrong.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The talleſt and ſtrongeſt of the <hi>Amorites</hi> (of theſe <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi> which the Lord deſtroyed before <hi>Iſrael</hi>) was <hi>Og</hi> the King of <hi>Baſan.</hi> Of his <hi>height</hi> and <hi>ſtrength,</hi> the <hi>Iewes</hi> make ſtrange reports.

For his <hi>ſtrength</hi> they ſay, when he had heard that the tents of the children of Iſrael, tooke vp the ſpace of <hi>three miles,</hi> he rooted vp a mountaine of <hi>like ſpace,</hi> and ſet it on his <hi>head,</hi> with purpoſe to caſt it vpon the <hi>tents</hi> of Iſrael: but as he caried it, <hi>Ants</hi> made a hole through the midſt of it, and ſo it deſcended and reſted vpon his necke: whence by reaſon of his teeth exceſſiuely increaſing and running into the holes of the <hi>mountaine,</hi> the <hi>mountaine</hi> ſtuck ſo faſt, that he could not remoue it, to caſt it, as he had purpoſed, vpon the campe of the Iſraelites.

                     <hi>Saul,</hi> the firſt of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was <hi>a choice yong man, and a goodly: there was not among the children of Iſrael a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier perſon then he: from his ſhoulders and vpward he was higher, then any of the people.</hi> He is ſo deſcribed, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.2.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliab</hi> had the <hi>prerogatiue of birth:</hi> he was the firſt-borne ſonne.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Maior in imperio]</hi> It is the ſecond <hi>prerogatiue</hi> of the eldeſt ſonne. It concernes his honor and ſtate of authoritie.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, what for <hi>prioritie</hi> of birth, and what for <hi>comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> of perſon, <hi>Eliab</hi> was by <hi>Samuel</hi> thought to be the man, whom the <hi>Lord</hi> had choſen for his <hi>King</hi> among all the ſons of <hi>Ieſſe.</hi> It ſeemes, <hi>Samuel</hi> thought ſo. For when <hi>Eliab</hi> was brought before him, he looked on him, and ſayd of him: <hi>Surely the Lords annointed is before him,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.6. Surely, <hi>Eliab</hi> is the man, whom the Lord hath deſigned to be his anointed.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Lord,</hi> the Lord <hi>who ſeeth not as man ſeeth,</hi> who <hi>reſpecteth not mans outward appearance,</hi> he refuſed <hi>Eliab.

                  <p>You haue hitherto heard of the varietie of mens ſtatures: you haue heard of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> that their <hi>height was like the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:1736:254"/> height of the</hi> Cedars: Of King <hi>Saul,</hi> that he was <hi>higher</hi> then any of his people, from the ſhoulders and vpward; of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liab,</hi> that he was <hi>high of ſtature;</hi> of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> that he was <hi>low of ſtature:</hi> This varietie of mens <hi>ſtatures</hi> is by euery dayes experience confirmed vnto you. And why is there ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of mens <hi>ſtatures?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One reaſon may be to ſtirre vs vp to this conſideration; that God is the moſt prouident author of euery mans <hi>ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> It is not in man, to adde any thing to his <hi>ſtature:</hi> not <hi>one cubite,</hi> ſayth our Sauiour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6 27. He ſayth it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Luke,</hi> 12.25. <hi>Which of you with taking thought, can adde one cubite to his ſtature?</hi> No man. No man can doe it. Nay, it is not in man, to amend the imperfections, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he is borne into the world. The man that was <hi>borne</hi> blind confeſſeth it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.32. <hi>Since the world began was it not heard, that any man opened the eyes of one that was borne blind.</hi> We cannot <hi>ſupply any defect</hi> wherwith we are borne into this world; much leſſe can we adde any thing vnto our <hi>ſtature?</hi> It may thus farre ſerue for our inſtruction, <hi>Vt ex illo capite neminem contemnamus, vel exagitemus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Franzius Diſp.</hi> 2. <hi>in Deuter. Theſ.</hi> 92. that we deſpiſe not any man, nor ſpeake ill of him for his <hi>ſtature,</hi> be it <hi>great</hi> or <hi>little,</hi> or for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>defect</hi> he hath in <hi>nature</hi> from his <hi>natiuitie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſecond reaſon, why there is ſuch varietie of <hi>ſtatures</hi> in the world, may be to let vs vnderſtand, that a mans <hi>ſtature</hi> of it ſelfe is not to be reckoned as a part of his felicitie or glory. For if a <hi>great</hi> and a <hi>goodly ſtature</hi> be as common, nay, more common to the <hi>wicked,</hi> then to the <hi>godly,</hi> as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſeemes to proue, <hi>De Civit.

                  <p>I haue ſtood long vpon the ſecond part of this verſe, the deſcription of the <hi>Amorites:</hi> the time requireth, that I goe on with the third part. It is the explication, or the ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, of the <hi>ruine of the Amorites.</hi> The words are,

                  <p>I paſſe by other like interpretations: theſe few may giue vs the true meaning of the words we haue in hand. The words are an explication or rather an amplification of the firſt part of this verſe, concerning the deſtruction of the <hi>Amorites.</hi> There the Lord ſaith, <hi>I deſtroyed the Amorite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them:</hi> here he ſaith, <hi>I deſtroyed his fruit from aboue, and his roots from beneath.</hi> From hence we know, that it was not any gentle ſtripe which the <hi>Amorites</hi> receiued, not any light inciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not any ſmall wound, but that it was their <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,</hi> their <hi>contrition,</hi> their <hi>vniuerſall ouerthrow,</hi> their <hi>vtter ruine.

                  </p>
                  <p>But when did this great deſtruction befall the <hi>Amorites?</hi> It befell them in the dayes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when the Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered ouer into the hands of Iſrael,<note n="t" place="margin">

                  <p>Is <hi>Iſrael</hi> now the conqueror? Is it the ſword of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that ſmiteth <hi>Sihon</hi> King of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and <hi>Og</hi> the King

                  </p>
                  <p>The anſwer is eaſie. <hi>Iſrael</hi> indeed ſmote the <hi>Amorites;</hi> but it was by the power of the Lord, not by any power of their owne. <hi>Moſes</hi> confeſſeth it of <hi>Sihon, King of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morites, Deut.</hi> 2.33. <hi>The Lord our God deliuered him vnto vs, and we ſmote him, and his ſonnes, and all his people.</hi> He confeſſeth it likewiſe of <hi>Og King of Baſhan, Deut.</hi> 3.3. <hi>The Lord our God deliuered into our hands Og the King of Baſhan, and all his people: and we ſmote him vntill none was left to him remayning.

There the people of God groning vnder their affliction in the middeſt of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, doe thus begin their confeſſion, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>We haue heard with our eares, O God, our fathers haue told vs, what worke thou diddeſt in their dayes, in the times of old.</hi> What this worke was they expreſſe <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Thou diddeſt driue out the Heathen with thine hand</hi>] Thou with thy hand didſt driue out the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and other the Heathen, and in their roomes didſt plant our fore-fathers. This was a great worke, and it was Gods worke. That it was Gods worke and his alone, they yet further acknowledge, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Our forefathers,</hi> they <hi>got not the land in poſſeſſion by their owne ſword, neither did their owne arme ſaue them: but thy right hand, and thine arme, and the light of thy countenance,</hi> O God, <hi>did ſtabliſh them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God was all in all in the ouerthrow of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and the reſt of the Heathen. By his ſtrength, by his might, by his power onely were they ouerthrowne. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore albeit <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſmote with the ſword <hi>Sihon</hi> King of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and <hi>Og</hi> the King of <hi>Baſhan, them</hi> and <hi>their people,</hi> their <hi>men,</hi> their <hi>women,</hi> and their <hi>litle ones,</hi> ſith they did it onely by the ſtrength, might, and power of the Lord, the Lord in my text doth rightly challenge the whole glory of this ouerthrow vnto himſelfe; ſaying firſt, <hi>I deſtroyed the Amorite before them:</hi> and againe, <hi>I deſtroyed his fruit from aboue, and his roots from beneath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence we may take a profitable leſſon. Its this,
<q>Though God vſe meanes for the performance of his counſels, yet the accompliſhment and glory of them, belongeth to him alone.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This truth is ſo euident, that it needs no further proofe. <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they were the meanes which God vſed for the performance of his counſels vpon the <hi>Amorites,</hi> euen to deſtroy them, and to roote them out from being a people, but the accompliſhment and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:1736:257"/> of that great worke was the Lords alone. <hi>The people of Iſrael,</hi> had they had much ado to ouercome their enemies, the <hi>Amorites,</hi> they might happily haue imputed ſomewhat to their owne force. They might haue ſaid; Shewed we not great power in the battle? Behaued we not our ſelues like men? Did not we fight valiantly?</p>
                  <p>But when their enemies were driuen like chaffe with the winde; when they, who earſt were ſtour, and ſtrong; were <hi>tall</hi> as the <hi>Cedars,</hi> and <hi>ſtrong</hi> as the <hi>Okes;</hi> when they ſhould extraordinarily be diſmaide; ſhould haue no more heart then a ſilly ſheepe hath; but ſhould be ſcattered at the firſt onſet; ſhould be ſo cowardly, as that their enemies might at their pleaſure ſlay them, till they were weary of ſlaying them; what can be ſaid of it? what can be thought of it? This is all. The Lord, who is Lord of battels, though he vſe <hi>meanes for the performance of his counſels,</hi> and for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieving of his victories, yet will he haue the <hi>accompliſhment</hi> and the <hi>glory</hi> of all to be peculiar vnto himſelfe. Thus is my doctrine illuſtrated.</p>
                  <q>Though God vſe meanes for the performance of his counſels, yet the accompliſhment and glory of them belongeth to him alone.</q>
                  <p>The reaſon hereof is, becauſe all <hi>power</hi> is Gods: and whatſoeuer <hi>power</hi> man hath to execute or performe what the counſell of the Lord hath appointed, its all deriued from God.</p>
                  <p>The vſe is, to teach vs, to yeeld God the <hi>honor</hi> of all the <hi>victories,</hi> that he giueth vs againſt our enemies. The honor of <hi>all victories</hi> muſt be his. When I ſay, <hi>all victories,</hi> I meone not onely the <hi>victories</hi> of Princes, when they make warre, or winne a battell in the field, but euen our <hi>priuate victories</hi> too: as, when we haue bin aſſailed by ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man, and are eſcaped from his hands; this is a <hi>victorie,</hi> and the <hi>honor of it</hi> muſt be the Lords.</p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:1736:258"/>
                  <p>If a neighbour, <hi>an vnkinde neighbour,</hi> hath done vs any wrong, or hath put vs to ſome trouble, &amp; we are deliuered from it, we muſt aſſure our ſelues, it is God that hath giuen vs the vpper hand, to the end, that we ſhould alwaies haue our mouthes open to giue him thanks for it. This muſt we doe; but this is not all. We muſt with the <hi>mouth</hi> giue <hi>thanks</hi> to God for giuing vs the vpper hand againſt thoſe that haue wrongfully moleſted and vexed <hi>vs;</hi> and beſides, we muſt endeuour by our whole life to ſhew forth, how much we are bound to God for our deliuerance. This is the ſcope, this is the end of our redemption and ſaluation, (according to old <hi>Zacharies</hi> prophecie, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74.) that <hi>being deliuered out of the hands of our enemies, we might ſerue God without feare, in holineſſe and righteouſnes before him all the dayes of our life.</hi>

                  <p>IN this tenth verſe are recounted two other benefits, which Almighty God was pleaſed to beſtow vpon his people, the people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> One was, Their <hi>deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from Aegypt.</hi> The other, Their <hi>protection and preſeruation in the wildernes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their <hi>deliuerance from Egypt</hi> is ſet downe, in the firſt clauſe; <hi>Alſo I brought you vp from the land of Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their protection and preſeruation in the wilderneſſe, in the next: <hi>And led you forty yeares through the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The end of both followeth in the end of the verſe: <hi>To poſſeſſe the land of the Amorite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They were <hi>deliuered from Egypt,</hi> and were <hi>for forty yeares protected in the wilderneſſe,</hi> that at length, and in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, they might <hi>poſſeſſe the land of the Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are to begin with their <hi>deliuerance from Egypt.</hi> Its in the firſt clauſe of the verſe:
<q>Alſo I brought you vp from the land of Egypt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>deliuerance</hi> of theirs out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was before the <hi>Amorites</hi> were deſtroyed, and yet the deſtruction of the <hi>Amorites</hi> is ſpecified in the former verſe. Why is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Gods benefits ſo inverted? Why is the benefit, that
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:1736:259"/> was firſt collated vpon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſpoken of in the ſecond place?</p>
                  <p>Some thinke it was aduiſedly and of purpoſe done, to preoccupate and preuent an obiection, which otherwiſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> might haue made. In the former verſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. it is ſaid, that the <hi>Amorites</hi> were deſtroyed, <hi>root</hi> and <hi>fruit,</hi> vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed before <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Now that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould not boaſt of that ouerthrow, or aſcribe it to the proweſſe and valour of their anceſtors, <hi>their deliuerance out of Egypt</hi> is nex ſet downe, in this 10. verſe, to put them in minde of the miſerable eſtate and condition, wherein their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers liued in <hi>Egypt:</hi> to this ſenſe: Thinke yee, O yee children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that the <hi>Amorites</hi> were deſtroyed by the proweſſe and valour of your fore-fathers? Thinke it not. Remember <hi>Egypt.</hi> Remember how there they groaned vnder the heauy yoke of oppreſſion, and were not able to helpe themſelues, and muſt of neceſſitie haue periſhed, had not the Lord with his ſtretched-forth arme deliuered them.</p>
                  <p>Others are of opinion, that this <hi>deliuerance of Iſrael out of Egypt,</hi> is in the ſecond place, and after the <hi>deſtruction of the Amorites,</hi> ſet downe, onely by a cuſtome of the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Of this opinion I finde <hi>S. Hierome</hi> to be. His rule is: The Scripture in ſetting forth the praiſes of God, doth not alwayes obſerue the order of the Hiſtorie: but it often comes to paſſe, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t quae prima facta ſunt, extrema dicantur, &amp; quae noviſſima, referantur ad prima:</hi> Things firſt done are laſt ſpoken of, and things laſt done are firſt recited. This he will haue vs to learne out of <hi>two Pſalmes,</hi> the 78. and 105. in which <hi>ſignorum potentia, non ordo deſcribitur,</hi> the power of Gods wonderfull workes, and not their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is deſcribed: and out of two other <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> the 3. and 52. <hi>Vbi, quae priùs facta ſunt, narrantur extrema, &amp; quae ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trema, referuntur in principio:</hi> What is firſt done is laſt ſpoken of, and what is laſt done is firſt mentioned. The <hi>third Pſalme</hi> was compoſed by <hi>Dauid,</hi> when he fled from
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:1736:259"/> 
                     <hi>Abſalom,</hi> his ſonne: the 52. when <hi>Doeg</hi> the <hi>Edomite</hi> came vnto <hi>Saul,</hi> and told him, that <hi>Dauid</hi> was come to the houſe of <hi>Abimelech.</hi> That of <hi>Abſalom</hi> is regiſtred, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.14. This of <hi>Doeg,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.9. The relation of <hi>Doeg</hi> is firſt chronicled, and long after that, <hi>Dauids flight</hi> from <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom:</hi> &amp; yet <hi>Dauids flight</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Abſalom</hi> is firſt mentioned in the Book of the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> and long after that, the relation of <hi>Doeg</hi> vnto <hi>Saul.</hi> The order of the Hiſtorie is not obſerued.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it obſerued in this our text. The order of the Hiſtorie is: firſt God brought the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 12.51. He made them to paſſe through the middeſt of the <hi>red Sea,</hi> as vpon dry land, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.22. And when they had finiſhed their <hi>two and forty iourneyes,</hi> through diuers wilderneſſes, then gaue he them victorie ouer <hi>Sihon King of the Amorites, Num.</hi> 21.24. The <hi>Amorites</hi> were <hi>laſt</hi> of all deſtroyed, and yet are they here <hi>firſt</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. <hi>Non eſt obſeruatus ordo,</hi> ſaith <hi>Mercer;</hi> the order of the Hiſtorie is not obſerued. <hi>Ribera</hi> alſo notes it. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thurinus Quadratus</hi> here frames a rule, like to that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Hierome, Scriptura in recenſendis Dei beneficijs curioſe non ſeruat ordinem.</hi> The <hi>Scripture</hi> in rehearſing Gods benefits doth not curiouſly keepe the order, but oftentimes it falls out by a <hi>figure,</hi> which the Greekes doe call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that what was <hi>first</hi> done, is <hi>laſt of all</hi> rehearſed; and what was <hi>laſt</hi> done is <hi>firſt of all</hi> recited. From hence we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this concluſion:
<q>Though it be our dutie carefully to remember the manifold bleſſings and benefits, which God in mercy from time to time hath beſtowed vpon vs; yet is it not neceſſarie, that we euer curiouſly obſerue their order, and the time when they were beſtowed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee the cuſtome of Scripture is our warrant, to ſpeake of that <hi>firſt,</hi> which was <hi>laſt</hi> done for vs; and of that <hi>laſt,</hi> which we <hi>firſt</hi> receiued. But, <hi>first</hi> or <hi>laſt,</hi> we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member all.</p>
                  <p>Hereto belongeth holy <hi>Dauids</hi> admonition, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.2. which he there propoſeth vnder the forme of an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:1736:260"/> He exhorteth himſelfe to bleſſe the Lord: <hi>Bleſſe the Lord, ô my ſoule, and forget not all his benefits.</hi> Forget not <hi>all</hi> his benefits! Nay: <hi>Forget</hi> not any of <hi>his benefits.</hi> So much the Hebrew phraſe intendeth. <hi>Bleſſe the Lord, ô my ſoule, and forget not</hi> any <hi>of his benefits.</hi> A neceſſarie admonition. We forget nothing ſooner then a <hi>benefit,</hi> whether we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it from God or man. But <hi>iniuriarum tenaciſſima est memoria;</hi> our memorie for iniuries, is very tenacious; its a hold-faſt. Let an <hi>iniurie</hi> be done vs, we will not forget it. Yea let one of vs beſtow vpon another any <hi>benefit,</hi> be it ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer ſo litle, the knowledg whereof ſhould not be imparted from the right hand to the left, as our Sauiour Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in his Sermon vpon the Mount, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.3. how long, how long will we reteine the memorie of it? Our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! its corrupt. Our diſpoſition! its peruerſe. Who ſeeth not, what neede there is, that we exerciſe our ſelues in reteyning the memorie of Gods benefits? Wherefore let euery one of vs ſtirre vp himſelfe to ſo holy an exerciſe, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did himſelfe: Let vs daily ſing vnto our ſoules: <hi>Bleſſe the Lord, ô my ſoule, and forget not all his benefits.</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not <hi>All!</hi> Nay; Forget not <hi>any</hi> of his benefits.

                  <p>Now from the non-obſeruance of the order of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie in this enumeration of Gods benefits vpon Iſrael, we are particularly to ſpeake of the benefit mentioned in the ſecond place. It is their deliuerance out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> The words are,

If ſo it were, it was doubtleſſe a great worke, a great iudgement of God vpon thoſe <hi>Egyptian</hi> monſters.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Eſay</hi> 19.1. their confuſion is againe foretold. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>the Lord rideth vpon a ſwift cloud, and ſhall come into Egypt, and the Idoles of Egypt ſhall moue at his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and the heart of Egypt ſhall melt in the midſt of it.</hi> Where the <hi>Idoles of Egypt</hi> are the <hi>heart of Egypt.</hi> They are called the <hi>heart of Egypt;</hi> becauſe the <hi>heart</hi> of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did wholy depend vpon them, for reliefe and ſuccour. <hi>The Lord rideth vpon a ſwift cloud and ſhall come into Egypt: and the Idoles of Egypt ſhall moue at his preſence, and the heart of Egypt ſhall melt in the midſt of it.</hi> The <hi>Idols</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhall moue and melt at the preſence of the <hi>Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Ierem.</hi> 43.13. their deſolation is likewiſe denounced. There the <hi>Lord</hi> threatneth to ſend <hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> the K. of <hi>Babylon,</hi> his ſeruant into <hi>Egypt.</hi> What ſhall he doe there? <hi>He ſhall breake the Images of Bethſhemeſh, that is in the land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and the houſes of the Gods of the</hi> Egyptians <hi>ſhall be burnt with fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee it confirmed not onely by Chriſtian wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and others, but alſo, by the ſacred volumes of holy Scripture; that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were a <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> and an <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous people.</hi>

                  <p>We are not yet out of the <hi>wilderneſſe</hi> of <hi>Etham.</hi> For from the <hi>Red Sea, Iſrael</hi> went three dayes iourney in the <hi>wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of <hi>Etham,</hi> and pitched in <hi>Marah.</hi> The ſtorie is ſo, <hi>Num.</hi> 33.8.

                  <p>From hence many thinke this <hi>wilderneſſe of Shur,</hi> to be the ſame with the <hi>wilderneſſe of Etham.</hi> Some will haue <hi>Etham</hi> to be the generall name of the whole wilderneſſe, and <hi>Shur</hi> onely a part of it.

                  <p>That the wilderneſſe <hi>Shur</hi> was no part of <hi>Egypt,</hi> I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the firſt of <hi>Samuel, Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. where I read, that <hi>Shur is ouer againſt Egypt.</hi> Its <hi>ouer againſt Egypt;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no part of <hi>Egypt.</hi> The like collection I make from the 25. of <hi>Geneſis, ver.</hi> 18. there I find, that <hi>Shur is before Egypt, as a man goeth to Aſſyria.</hi> Its before <hi>Egypt;</hi> therefore not in <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor any part of <hi>Egypt:</hi> therefore <hi>Shur</hi> is not <hi>Etham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why then doth <hi>Moſes</hi> in the places now alledged, ſeeme to make <hi>Shur</hi> and <hi>Etham</hi> all one?

<q>
                        <pb n="258" facs="tcp:1736:267"/>I led you through the wilderneſſe.</q>

                  <p>So ſpeaketh the <hi>Pſalmist,</hi> in that his remarkeable exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to giue thankes to God for particular mercies. It is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.16. O, giue thankes<note n="p" place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Let it be our comfort. God neuer forſakes his people.

                  <p>THe bleſſings and benefits which <hi>Amos</hi> in this Chapter remembreth to haue beene beſtowed by Almightie <hi>God</hi> vpon his people, the ten tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> are partly <hi>Corporall,</hi> and partly <hi>Spirituall.</hi> Of their <hi>Corporall</hi> benefits I haue heretofore in your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring diſcourſed in my two former Sermons. They were the <hi>deſtruction of the</hi> Amorites <hi>before them,</hi> and <hi>for their ſake, verſ.</hi> 9. their <hi>deliuerance out of</hi> Egypt, their <hi>protection and preſeruation in the wilderneſſe for fortie yeares,</hi> to the end that they might at length <hi>poſſeſſe the land of the</hi> Amorite, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. Theſe were notable <hi>benefits,</hi> though they were but <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</hi> But the <hi>benefit,</hi> whereof I am now to ſpeake, is <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</hi> It is the doctrine of the ſincere worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> and of eternall ſaluation, together with the free vſe and paſſage thereof: or if you will, it is the ordinary miniſtery of the <hi>Word,</hi> thus expreſſed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The other is, A <hi>teſtification,</hi> that ſuch a benefit was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed; <hi>Is it not euen thus, ô ye children of Iſrael, ſaith the Lord?</hi>

                     <hi>Prophets]</hi> I read in the old <hi>Teſtament</hi> of two ſorts of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> Some were taught in <hi>Schooles</hi> vnder the diſcipline of other <hi>Prophets;</hi> who were heretofore called <hi>Filij Propheta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> ſonnes of the <hi>Prophets.</hi> They are ſo called, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 4.1. &amp; 6.1. Others had their calling immediately from <hi>God,</hi> and were by him extraordinarily inſpired with gifts from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:1736:271"/> and ſo were ſent forth to the exerciſe of their holy function. Of both theſe <hi>Amos chap.</hi> 7.14. maketh menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There he ſaith vnto <hi>Amaziah: I</hi> was <hi>no Prophet,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was <hi>I a Prophets ſonne,</hi> but <hi>I was an heardman, and a gatherer of Sycomore fruit.</hi> This he ſpeaketh of himſelfe, as he was before his calling. <hi>I was no Prophet,</hi> immediately called of <hi>God;</hi> nor was <hi>I the ſonne of a Prophet;</hi> I was not trained vp or taught in any of the Schooles of the <hi>Prophets:</hi> but I was an <hi>heardman,</hi> and <hi>a gatherer of Sycomore fruit.</hi> He had no other calling, till the <hi>Lord</hi> was pleaſed to aduance him to the dignitie and office of a <hi>Prophet:</hi> and then was his calling extraordinarie. <hi>Amos</hi> tels, how it was, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>The Lord tooke me as I followed the flocke, and the Lord ſaid vnto me, Goe prophecie vnto my people Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Prophets</hi> mentioned in my text, may be of both ſorts: ſuch as had their inſtitution in the Schooles of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and ſuch as were called of <hi>God</hi> immediately and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily. <hi>God</hi> was the raiſer vp of both. Yet eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Prophets</hi> here, I vnderſtand, ſuch as had their calling of <hi>God</hi> immediate, and extraordinarie. And theſe were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their holy function ſundrie wayes: as, by <hi>dreames,</hi> by <hi>viſions,</hi> by <hi>inſpiration</hi> of the holy Spirit, by <hi>expreſſe word,</hi> vttered by ſome <hi>Angell</hi> repreſenting <hi>God;</hi> and by <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſpeaking to them face to face.</p>
                  <p>That they were fitted to their <hi>Propheticall</hi> function by <hi>dreames</hi> and <hi>viſions.</hi> We know by, <hi>Num.</hi> 12.6. where the <hi>Lord</hi> thus ſpeaketh vnto <hi>Aaron,</hi> and to <hi>Miriam: Heare now my words. If there be a</hi> Prophet <hi>among you, I the Lord will make my ſelfe knowne vnto him in a viſion, and will ſpeake vnto him in a dreame.</hi> We know it likewiſe by <hi>Elihues</hi> words vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Iob, chap.</hi> 33.14. <hi>God ſpeaketh once, yea twice, yet man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth it not. In a dreame, in a viſion of the night, when deepe ſleepe falleth vpon men, in ſlumbrings vpon the bed: Then he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth the eares of men, and ſealeth their inſtruction.</hi> It may alſo be gathered out of the euen-now cited place of <hi>Ioel, chap.</hi> 2.28. <hi>I will powre of my Spirit vpon all fleſh, and your ſonnes and your daughters ſhall prophecie, your old men ſhall
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:1736:271"/> dreame dreames, your yong men ſhall ſee viſions.</hi> Dreames and viſions, you ſee, were meanes by which Almightie <hi>God</hi> fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his <hi>Prophets</hi> to the exerciſe of their holy function.</p>
                  <p>They were likewiſe fitted thereunto, by <hi>the inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſayth it, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 1. verſ. 21. <hi>Holy men of God in old time ſpake, as they were mooued by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> So were they, by <hi>the expreſſe word of ſome</hi> Angell <hi>repreſenting God;</hi> as, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.13. There ſhall you find two <hi>Angels</hi> inſtructing <hi>Lot</hi> concerning the ouerthrow of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> And ſometime they were enabled to their holy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by <hi>God</hi> himſelfe, ſpeaking to them <hi>face to face.</hi> So was <hi>Moſes.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> ſpake vnto <hi>Moſes face to face,</hi> as a man ſpeaketh vnto his friend. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.11.</p>
                  <p>Now whether <hi>Prophets</hi> of old time, were enabled to the exerciſe of their ſacred function by <hi>God</hi> himſelfe, ſpeaking vnto them <hi>face to face,</hi> or by the <hi>apparition</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting <hi>God,</hi> or by the <hi>inſpiration</hi> of the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> or by <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> or by <hi>dreames,</hi> it was out of doubt a great bleſſing vnto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to haue <hi>Prophets</hi> ſent vnto them: and therefore ſaith the <hi>Lord</hi> vnto them, <hi>I raiſed vp of your ſonnes for Prophets.</hi> It followeth,

                  <p>
                     <hi>Of your yong men]</hi> It is emphatically ſpoken.

                     <hi>Nazirites]</hi> You now ſee what they are. They were yong men conſecrated to the ſtudie of the word of God, and trained vp therevnto, euen from their childhood, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſeuere diſcipline, and an auſtere courſe of life, that at length they might be able to goe before the people, as well by <hi>ſoundnes of doctrine,</hi> as by the <hi>example of a good life.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I raiſed vp of your ſonnes for Prophets, and of your yong men for Nazirites.] Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Nazirites.</hi> Some haue put this difference betweene them: that the <hi>Prophets</hi> indeed taught the people the law of God, and withall foretold things to come: whereas the <hi>Nazirites</hi> did only teach the law. Be it ſo or otherwiſe; the meaning of my text is this. <hi>God</hi> would haue the miniſterie of his word to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie, and perpetuall, among the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and for that end, he gaue them <hi>Prophets</hi> of their ſonnes, men of riper yeares; and <hi>Nazirites</hi> of their yong men, who were to be trained vp in Scholes among them, there to be fitted for the holy miniſterie. Such is the bleſſing (and it is a very great one) which is here mentioned to haue bin beſtowed by the Lord vpon Iſrael. It is (as I ſaid in the beginning of this exerciſe) it is the doctrine of the ſincere worſhip of God, and of eternall ſaluation, togither with the free vſe and paſſage thereof: or, if you will, it is the ordinarie miniſterie of the word.

                  <p>If ſo it be: if the <hi>Goſpell of Chriſt</hi> be the <hi>word of Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> if it be the <hi>doctrine of Peace,</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> betweene <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man,</hi> betweene <hi>man</hi> and <hi>man,</hi> betweene <hi>man</hi> and <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:</hi> if it be the <hi>doctrine of good things,</hi> of our deliuerance from <hi>ſinne,</hi> from <hi>death,</hi> and from the <hi>curſe of the Law:</hi> if it be the <hi>doctrine of the Kingdome;</hi> the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>glory.</hi> then muſt it be granted, that the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> do bring with them bleſſings of an ineſtimable value. And ſuch is my doctrine;
<q>The miniſterie of the word of God freely exerciſed in any nation, is to that nation a bleſſing of an ineſtimable value.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vſe hereof concerneth the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and their auditors. Firſt, the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Gospell.</hi> They may here be put in minde of their dutie, which is willingly and cheerefully to preach the <hi>Goſpell.</hi> This their dutie may be called a <hi>debt. S. Paul</hi> calls it ſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.14, 15. <hi>I am deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor both to the Grecians and to the Barbarians, both to the wiſe men, and to the vnwiſe. Therefore as much as in me is, I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to preach the Gospell to you alſo that are at Rome. S. Paul</hi>
                     <pb n="277" facs="tcp:1736:276"/> (you ſee) acknowledgeth a <hi>debt,</hi> and makes a conſcience of diſcharging it. The obligation or bond whereby he was made a <hi>debter</hi> was his <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> calling: his <hi>debt</hi> was, to <hi>preach the Goſpell:</hi> the perſons to whom he was <hi>indebted,</hi> were <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> the <hi>wiſe</hi> and the <hi>vnwiſe.</hi> His good conſcience to diſcharge his debt, appeareth in his readineſſe to doe it: <hi>I am ready, as much as in me is, to preach the Goſpell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>S. Paul</hi> may be vnto vs a patterne of imitation. We alſo muſt acknowledge a <hi>debt,</hi> and muſt make a <hi>conſcience</hi> of diſcharging it. The obligation or bond whereby we are made <hi>debtors</hi> is our <hi>miniſteriall</hi> calling. Our <hi>debt</hi> is, to <hi>preach the Goſpell.</hi> The perſons to whom we are indebted, are <hi>our owne flocke,</hi> our owne people, the people ouer whom the Lord hath made vs ouer-ſeers. Our good <hi>conſcience</hi> to diſcharge our debt will appeare in our readineſſe to doe it. I, and euery other <hi>miniſter</hi> of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> muſt ſay, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> doth, <hi>I am ready, as much as in me is, to preach the Goſpell</hi> to you. So farre forth as God ſhall permit and make way for diſcharge, <hi>I am ready to preach the Goſpell</hi> to you. Nothing hath hitherto, or ſhall hereafter with hold me from paying you this <hi>debt,</hi> but onely the impediments which the Lord obiecteth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the vſe of my doctrine concerneth <hi>you,</hi> who are the <hi>hearers</hi> of the <hi>word.</hi> You alſo may here be put in minde of your dutie, which is patiently and attentiuely to <hi>heare</hi> the word preached. Of your readineſſe in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe I ſhould not doubt, if you would but remember what an vnvaluable treaſure it is, which we bring vnto you. Is it not the <hi>word of Saluation,</hi> the <hi>Saluation</hi> of your ſoules? Is it not your <hi>peace</hi> inward, and outward, your <hi>peace</hi> with God, your <hi>peace</hi> with man, your <hi>peace</hi> with your owne conſciences? Is it not the <hi>doctrine of good things,</hi> your deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance from ſinne, from death, and from the curſe of the Law? Is it not the publication of the <hi>Kingdome of God,</hi> his <hi>kingdome</hi> of <hi>gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:1736:277"/> euen thus? Can it be denyed?</p>
                  <p>Beloued in the Lord, the Lord who raiſed vp vnto the ten Tribes of Iſrael of their <hi>ſonnes</hi> for <hi>Prophets,</hi> and of their <hi>yong men</hi> for <hi>Nazarites,</hi> he raiſeth vp vnto you of your ſonnes <hi>Miniſters, Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Teachers;</hi> and of your <hi>yong men,</hi> ſuch as may be trayned vp and fitted in the Scholes of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> in our <hi>Naioths,</hi> in our <hi>

                  <p>Its an admirable and a gracious diſpenſation from God, to ſpeake vnto man, not in his <hi>owne perſon,</hi> and by the voice of his<note n="k" place="margin">

                     <hi>paſſions,</hi> whereto <hi>we</hi> are. Admirable and gracious is this diſpenſation.</p>
                  <p>God thus borrowing, and vſing the tongues of men to ſpeake vnto men, doth it <hi>quaſi imperans, non quaſi mendicans,</hi> (as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>Serm.</hi> 5. vpon the <hi>Canticles</hi>) he doth it not <hi>begging,</hi> but <hi>commanding:</hi> and in that he doth it, <hi>indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentia eſt, non indigentia;</hi> it is not from any want in himſelfe, but it is from his <hi>indulgence</hi> and fauour vnto vs: and in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it <hi>non efficaciam quaerit, ſed congruentiam,</hi> he ſeekes not any ſtrength to his owne words, but congruence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to our infirmities? Its euen ſo. For we were not able to beare the glory of that <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> if it did not in ſome ſort hide and temper it ſelfe vnder theſe earthly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore when we take the counſels of <hi>God</hi> from the lips of our <hi>ſonnes,</hi> and of our <hi>yong men,</hi> from the lips of our <hi>Brethren,</hi> from the lips of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> we may ſay of them, as the men of <hi>Liſtra</hi> once ſaid of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:1736:277"/> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> but renouncing the idolatry of the ſpeach, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.11. <hi>God is come downe to vs in the likeneſſe of men. God</hi> is he that ſpeaketh from aboue, that bleſſeth and curſeth, that bindeth and looſeth, that exhorteth and dehorteth by the mouth of his <hi>Miniſters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For this reſpect and relations ſake betweene <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> whom it hath pleaſed him to dignifie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in ſome ſort with the repreſentation of his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon vpon earth, they haue euer heretofore bin holden in very reuerend eſtimation. Such was the eſtimation hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of <hi>S. Paul</hi> by the <hi>Galatians. S. Paul</hi> himſelfe confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14, 15. where he beares them record, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit through <hi>infirmitie of the fleſh,</hi> he preached the <hi>Goſpell</hi> vnto them at the firſt, yet they <hi>deſpiſed</hi> him <hi>not, or reiected</hi> him, but <hi>receiued</hi> him as an <hi>Angell</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> euen as <hi>Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus:</hi> yea, that if it had bin poſſible (Nature and the Law forbidding it) they would haue <hi>plucked out</hi> their owne <hi>eyes,</hi> and <hi>giuen them</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p>But why ſpeake I of the reuerend regard giuen to <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> or to any other the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the word of God in the primitiue times of the Church? Looke ye but to the dayes of late, to the dayes of your Fathers; and you will ſee them in very high eſteeme. Then, though your Prieſts, were but <hi>Lignei ſacerdotes,</hi> wooden prieſts, prieſts of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> that were your leaders and your guides, you highly honoured them. You beſtowed vpon them your <hi>eareings,</hi> and your <hi>frontlets,</hi> your lands and reuenewes to maintaine them in their <hi>Couents,</hi> and <hi>Cloyſters.</hi> To euery <hi>Fryer</hi> that drew you aſide to confeſſe you, you ſubmitted your ſelues, with <hi>Pater meus es tu,</hi> you are my <hi>Father,</hi> my <hi>ghoſtly Father.</hi> So farre were you from <hi>deſpiſing</hi> or <hi>reiecting</hi> them, that yee <hi>receiued</hi> them as <hi>Angels</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> yea as <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Such honour had the <hi>Prieſts</hi> in your fore-fathers dayes.</p>
                  <p>No maruaile, will ſome ſay. For then <hi>Religion</hi> had ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vp <hi>Policie,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> had deuoured the <hi>Common-wealth, Cloyſters</hi> were richer in treaſure, then <hi>Kings houſes,</hi>

                  <p>True, I grant: the times are changed indeed. For as a worthy <hi>Prelat</hi> yet liuing (<hi>Lect.</hi> 34. <hi>in Ionam</hi>) ſpeaketh: Now <hi>Policie</hi> hath eaten vp <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>men</hi> rob <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> expoſtulateth, <hi>Malac.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Men rob God</hi> againſt all equitie and conſcience. But wherein doe they rob him? In <hi>tithes</hi> and <hi>offerings.</hi> His <hi>tithes</hi> and <hi>offerings</hi> are tranſlated to <hi>ſtrangers:</hi> they eat the materiall bread of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> who neuer giue them ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall foode: and they that ſerue not at the <hi>Altar,</hi> do liue by it: whereas many a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> that ſerueth at the <hi>Altar,</hi> hath not whereon to liue. Hence is the <hi>Miniſterie</hi> growne into contempt; and they who ſhould be honoured for their <hi>calling ſake,</hi> are for their <hi>wants ſake</hi> very baſely thought of.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeake not this to taxe you of this place: you <hi>rob not God,</hi> but do duely pay your <hi>tithes</hi> and <hi>offerings;</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> here hath its right; and euer may it haue to your comfort. But I do it to moue you to lift vp your hearts to the throne of grace, and to bleſſe the Lord, for as much as when the <hi>tythes</hi> and <hi>offerings</hi> of ſome of your <hi>neighbour Villages</hi> are made <hi>appropriate,</hi> yours are by Gods goodnes exempted from the <hi>ſpoyle,</hi> and reſerued to their <hi>proper vſe:</hi> whereby you may in all ages be prouided, though not of <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Nazirites,</hi> ſuch as God raiſed vp vnto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but of <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> ſuch as may be able to breake vnto you the <hi>bread of life,</hi> and to preach vnto you the <hi>Goſpell</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is the <hi>Goſpell</hi> of <hi>Saluation,</hi> the <hi>Goſpell</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> the <hi>Goſpell</hi> of <hi>good things,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpell</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto you haue heard, that God beſtowed a benefit of ineſtimable value vpon the ten tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in <hi>raiſing</hi> vp vnto them of their <hi>ſonnes</hi> for <hi>Prophets,</hi> and of their <hi>yong men</hi> for <hi>Nazirites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now followeth the <hi>Teſtification</hi> that ſuch a benefit was

                  <p>The Lord is he, that moues the <hi>queſtion,</hi> the <hi>children of Iſrael</hi> are they to whom the queſtion is moued: the <hi>queſtion</hi> is, <hi>Is it not euen thus? Is it not euen thus, ô ye children of Iſrael, ſaith the Lord?</hi>

                  <p>Neither the time, nor your patience will giue way to the ſeuerall handling of theſe particulars: nor is there any neede of enlargment, the words are ſo plaine and without obſcuritie.

                  </p>
                  <p>The points of doctrine from hence to be collected are diuers;</p>

                  <p>IN this propheticall Sermon written by <hi>Amos</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> I haue heretofore in my eight Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vpon this Chapter, obſerued foure principall parts;
<list>
                        <item>A <hi>Reprehenſion.</hi>
                        </item>

                        <item>An <hi>Exprobation,</hi> and</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt is, a <hi>reproofe</hi> of <hi>Iſraell</hi> for ſinne, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6.7.8.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, a <hi>recitall</hi> of the benefits which God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> verſ. 9.10.11.</p>
                  <p>The third, a <hi>twyting</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with their vnthankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>The fourth, a <hi>threatning</hi> of <hi>puniſhment</hi> to befall them, from the 13. <hi>verſe,</hi> to the end of the Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Of the two former, the <hi>Reprehenſion</hi> and the <hi>Enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> you haue at ſundry times alreadie heard. Now are we to proceed to the <hi>Exprobation,</hi> conteined in the words at this time read vnto you.</p>
                  <p>For our eaſier vnderſtanding whereof, we are to caſt backe an eye vpon thoſe <hi>benefits</hi> which in the precedent verſes are mentioned to haue beene beſtowed by the <hi>Lord</hi> vpon his people <hi>Iſrael.</hi> They were either <hi>Corporall</hi> or <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:1736:280"/> Corporall,</hi> as the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of the <hi>Amorites</hi> before the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and for their ſakes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. their <hi>deliuerance</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> their protection and preſeruation in the <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe</hi> for <hi>fortie yeares</hi> together, that at length they might poſſeſſe the land of the <hi>Amorite, verſ.</hi> 10. And <hi>Spirituall,</hi> as the doctrine of the ſincere <hi>worſhip</hi> of God, and of eternall ſaluation, together with the free vſe and paſſage thereof, expreſſed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. by the raiſing vp of their <hi>ſonnes</hi> for <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;</hi> and of their <hi>yong men</hi> for <hi>Nazirites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe were very great <hi>benefits,</hi> and worthy all thankfull acknowledgement. But the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were ſo farre from giuing thankes for them, that they<note n="a" place="margin">Ruffinus.</note> vilely eſteemed them, and too too contemptuouſly reiected them. This appeareth in this 12. <hi>verſe,</hi> which I therefore call an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probration,</hi> an <hi>vpbraiding,</hi> or <hi>twyting</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their<note n="b" place="margin">Albertus Magnus.</note> ingratitude. Two things here are ſaid vnto their charge: one is, Their <hi>ſolliciting</hi> the <hi>Nazirites</hi> to breake their vow. The other is their <hi>hindering</hi> the <hi>Prophets</hi> in the execution of their function. The firſt in theſe words, <hi>yee gaue</hi> the Nazirites <hi>wine to drinke.</hi> The ſecond in theſe, <hi>yee commaunded the</hi> Prophets, <hi>ſaying</hi> Prophecie not. Of theſe in their order.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, their <hi>ſolliciting</hi> the <hi>Nazirites to breake their vow: Ye gaue the</hi> Nazarites <hi>wine to drinke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the name of <hi>Nazirites,</hi> and of their inſtitution, I ſpake in my laſt exerciſe out of this place. I will not now ſpend time vpon the repetition of that, I then deliuered. It ſhall ſuffice, if I adde but a word or two for the further illuſtration thereof.</p>

                     <hi>Nazirites</hi> had their name of <hi>Nazar,</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to <hi>ſeparate.</hi> They were yong men, <hi>ſeparate</hi> from the ordinarie courſe of men, and bound to a certaine peculiar courſe and profeſſion of life. They were <hi>Eccleſiae ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> ſayth<note n="d" place="margin">Harmon. in <hi>4</hi>

                     <hi>Calvin, ornaments of the Church,</hi> and God would in them, as in a glaſſe make his honor and glorie in ſome ſort to appeare. They were, <hi>quaſi pretioſae gemmae,</hi> to ſhine as rich Iewels among the people of God. They were, <hi>tanquam
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:1736:280"/> ſigniferi, ante ſignani, &amp; duces,</hi> as ſtandard-bearers, ring-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and chiefetaines to ſhew the way of diuine worſhip vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others.</p>
                  <p>Singular was the honor and dignitie of this order and calling of <hi>Nazirites. Ieremie</hi> in his <hi>Lamentations chap.</hi> 4.7. thus ſets them forth. <hi>Her</hi> Nazirites <hi>were purer then ſnow, they were whiter then milke, they were more ruddie in body then Rubies, they were like poliſhed Saphyres.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The author of this order and calling is <hi>God.</hi> This appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the verſe next before my text. There the <hi>Lord</hi> hath ſayd, <hi>I haue raiſed vp of your yong men for Nazirites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt branch of the <hi>Law,</hi> that concerneth this order and calling is accurately deſcribed, <hi>Num,</hi> 6.3, 4. <hi>Whoſoeuer ſhall vow the vow of a</hi> Nazirite, <hi>he ſhall abſteine from wine and ſtrong drinke, he ſhall drinke no vineger of wine, or vineger of ſtrong drinke, neither ſhall be drinke any liquor of grapes, nor eate moiſt grapes nor dried. All the dayes of his</hi> Naziriteſhip <hi>ſhall he eate nothing that is made of the vine tree from the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels euen to the huske.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Nazirites</hi> for the time of their <hi>Naziriteſhip</hi> were to apply themſelues wholy to the ſtudie of the law of God, and therfore was abſtinence from <hi>wine</hi> and <hi>ſtrong drinke</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned them. God would haue them refraine all things that might trouble the <hi>braine,</hi> ſtirre vp <hi>luſt,</hi> and make them vnfitly diſpoſed for ſo holy a <hi>ſtudie:</hi> of which ſort are <hi>wine</hi> and <hi>ſtrong drinke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Salomon</hi> ſo accounts of them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.1. For there he ſaith, <hi>Wine is a mocker, ſtrong drinke is raging, and whoſoeuer is deceiued thereby is not wiſe. Salomons</hi> Mother doth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſo account of them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.4. There her counſaile to her ſonne is: <hi>It is not for Kings,</hi> O <hi>Lemuel,</hi> it is not for Kings to <hi>drinke wine, nor for Princes to drinke ſtrong drinke: left they being drunken, forget the Law, and peruert the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any of the afflicted.</hi> For this cauſe alſo were the <hi>Prieſts</hi> forbidden <hi>wine,</hi> when they were to goe into the tabernacle of the Congregation, and that vpon paine of death. The prohibition is, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.9. There thus ſaith the <hi>Lord</hi> to
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:1736:281"/> 
                     <hi>Aaron; Doe not drinke wine, nor ſtrong drinke, thou nor thy ſonnes with thee, when yee goe into the Tabernacle of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, leſt ye die. It ſhall be a ſtatute for euer throughout your generations.</hi> Hitherto I referre that, <hi>Exech.</hi> 44.21. <hi>No prieſt ſhall drinke wine, when he entereth into the inner court.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the places now alledged ariſeth this poſition:
<q>Sobrietie is a vertue fit for all men, but eſpecially for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the word and Sacraments. <hi>Eſpecially for</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſons are:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is not for <hi>Miniſters</hi> to ſpeake fooliſhly, or to doe any thing vndecently. Yet can they not but offend both in the one and the other, if they ſuffer themſelues to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome with ſwilling of <hi>wine</hi> or <hi>ſtrong drinke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is for <hi>Miniſters,</hi> to be vigilant in their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; to be diligent in their miniſteriall imployments, in reading, in ſtudie, in meditation to be deuout in their praiers vnto God for themſelues &amp; the people, ouer whom God hath made them ouerſeers; to handle the word of life reuerently, and to diſpenſe it in due ſeaſon to euery weary ſoule. Yet muſt they needs faile in the performance of theſe duties, if they giue themſelues to the drinking of <hi>wine</hi> and <hi>ſtrong drinke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here may all that ſerue at the <hi>Altar</hi> be admoniſhed, euermore to be mindfull of their calling, and of the hatred which God hath of exceſſe in men deuouted to his ſeruice, aboue all others; as alſo of the fearefull iudgement, that will in the end without all faile enſue. For if of all it be true, that the <hi>drunkard</hi> ſhal neuer enter <hi>into the kingdome of God</hi> (which you know to be true, and the holy Spirit hath paſſed it for a truth, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 10.) then muſt it needs be ſealed vp in the conſcience of any <hi>Miniſter,</hi> that a <hi>Miniſter</hi> through his exceſſe in <hi>drinking</hi> cauſing the holy things of God to be deſpiſed, ſhall <hi>neuer, neuer</hi> come within the gates, of that eternall ioy, but in ſtead thereof ſhall reape the reward of his ſinne in euerlaſting torments, both of bodie and ſoule. But this by the way.</p>
                  <p>The thing wherewith the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in my text ſtand
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:1736:281"/> charged, is, their giuing the <hi>Nazirites</hi> wine to drinke. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> knew full well, that it was the peremptorie man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date and expreſſe commandement of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that the <hi>Nazirites</hi> ſhould abſteine from <hi>wine,</hi> and <hi>ſtrong drinke:</hi> yet did they contrary thereunto giue vnto the <hi>Nazirites</hi> wine to drinke.</p>
                  <p>Gaue they the <hi>Nazirites</hi> wine to drinke? was this ſuch an offence, that God ſhould take diſpleaſure at it? To what end then ſerues the precept of giuing <hi>wine</hi> to him, that is readie to periſh through the anxietie and bitterneſſe of his minde, that thereby he may be cheared and comforted? The precept is, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.6. <hi>Giue ſtrong drinke vnto him that is readie to periſh, and wine vnto thoſe that be of heauie hearts. Let him drinke, and forget his pouertie, and remember his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery no more.</hi> In vaine were this precept, were the drinking of <hi>wine</hi> an offence, whereat <hi>God</hi> ſhould take diſpleaſure. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth amiſſe, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.23. to wiſh him <hi>to drinke no longer water,</hi> but <hi>to vſe a little wine for his ſtomackes ſake, and his often infirmities;</hi> if the drinking of <hi>wine</hi> be an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. If the drinking of <hi>wine</hi> be an offence, why doth the ſame Apoſtle tell the <hi>Romans, chap.</hi> 14.17. that <hi>the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God conſisteth not in meate and drinke,</hi> thereby giuing them libertie, not onely to <hi>eate,</hi> but alſo to <hi>drinke</hi> what they would, euen to drinke wine?</p>
                  <p>To this I ſay: It is not of it ſelfe any offence <hi>to drinke wine,</hi> or to giue others <hi>wine to drinke;</hi> but herein conſiſteth the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that they gaue the <hi>Nazirites wine to drinke</hi> contrary to the Law of God, and his holy comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. <hi>Tolle verbum Domini, et liberum eſt vinum bibere: adde verbum Domini, &amp; vinum exhibere aut bibere, tam gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de eſt nefas, quàm adulterium aut latrocinium.</hi> So <hi>Brentius.</hi> Let there be no law, no commandement of God againſt <hi>the drinking of wine,</hi> and you may at your pleaſure <hi>drinke wine:</hi> But if Gods law and commaundement be againſt it, then for a man to <hi>drinke wine</hi> himſelfe, or to giue others <hi>wine to drinke,</hi> its as great a ſinne, as <hi>adulterie,</hi> or <hi>robbery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe had a law giuen him, that hee ſhould
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:1736:282"/> not eate of the tree of knowledge of good and euill. The law is expreſſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Of the tree of knowledge of good and euill thou ſhalt not eate of it; for in the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> To eate an Apple was of it ſelfe but a ſmall matter; but the <hi>Law of God,</hi> whereby the eating of the Apple was forbidden, was a matter of great weight. The very <hi>eating of the Apple</hi> God did not much care for: it was the obſeruance of his commandement, and the obedience thereunto, that he required.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saul</hi> had a commandement giuen him, that he ſhould goe downe to <hi>Gilgal,</hi> and tarry there ſeauen dayes, till <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> ſhould come, and direct him what to doe. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is expreſſed, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.8. <hi>Thou ſhalt goe downe before me to</hi> Gilgal, <hi>and behold, I will come downe vnto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to ſacrifice ſacrifices of peace offerings: ſeauen dayes ſhalt thou tarrie, till I come to thee, and ſhew thee what thou ſhalt doe.</hi> According to this commandement, <hi>Saul</hi> went to <hi>Gilgal,</hi> and tarried there<note n="e" place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.8.</note> 
                     <hi>ſeauen dayes</hi> according to the ſet time that <hi>Samuel</hi> had appoynted. The ſeauenth day a little before <hi>Samuel</hi> came, <hi>Saul</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9.</note> offered a burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.<note n="g" place="margin">
                        <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10.</note> As ſoone as he had made an end of offering <hi>the burnt offering, Samuel</hi> came. <hi>Saul</hi> vnderſtanding thereof went out to meete him, that he might ſalute him. <hi>Samuel</hi> ſeeing what was done, tells <hi>Saul,</hi> that he had done<note n="h" place="margin">
                        <hi>Verſ.</hi> 13</note> 
                     <hi>fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> in not keeping the commandement of the <hi>Lord</hi> his <hi>God,</hi> which he commaunded him: and withall foretells him of a heauie iudgement to befall him,<note n="i" place="margin">
                        <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Thy kingdome ſhall not continue.</hi> The offering of the <hi>Holocauſte</hi> or <hi>burnt offering</hi> to the <hi>Lord,</hi> was it not of it ſelfe a good worke? Yet becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> offered it out of due time, namely before <hi>Samuel</hi> was come, it was ſinne vnto him, and the loſſe of his <hi>kingdome.</hi> Did the <hi>Lord</hi> care for the preoccupation, or preuention of ſo little time, as if it were a matter of it ſelfe to be regarded? No: it was the <hi>obſeruance</hi> of his commandement, and the obedience thereunto, that he required.</p>
                  <p>So for my text I ſay: <hi>The giuing the Nazirites wine to drinke,</hi> was not of it ſelfe a matter that the <hi>Lord</hi> much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded:
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:1736:282"/> but it was the <hi>obſeruance</hi> of his commaundement, and the <hi>obedience</hi> thereunto, that he required. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement I euen now repeated vnto you out of <hi>Num.</hi> 6. The ſumme of it is, The <hi>Nazarite</hi> ſhall abſteine <hi>from wine and ſtrong drinke.</hi> Contrary to this commandement, did the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> here giue vnto the <hi>Nazarites</hi> wine to drink: which is the thing, wherewith they are here twyted, to this ſenſe: <hi>Ye gaue the Nazarites wine to drinke:</hi> in ſo doing you made proofe of your contempt of my Law, and your diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereunto. I looked you ſhould haue beene thankefull vnto mee, for beſtowing ſo great a benefit vpon you, as is the order and calling of the <hi>Nazarites,</hi> for the trayning vp of your yong men in pietie and religion: but you, <hi>vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full you,</hi> haue repaid me with contempt, and diſobedience, you haue ſollicited the <hi>Nazarites</hi> to breake their vow and contrary to my Law, <hi>yee gaue them wine to drinke.</hi> The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine we are to gather from hence, is,
<q>Diſobedience againſt Gods holy lawes and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, is a ſinne, carefully to be eſchewed by euery child of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As by the knowledge of <hi>light</hi> we may know what <hi>darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> is, and by the knowledge of <hi>good</hi> what <hi>euill</hi> is, ſo by the knowledge of <hi>obedience</hi> towards God, we may know what <hi>diſobedience</hi> againſt him is. Of <hi>obedience</hi> towards God I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated in my fift Lecture vpon this Chapter. I then hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this concluſion. <hi>Obedience to the commandements of the Lord, is a dutie, which the Lord requireth to be performed by euery child of his.</hi> Whence by the Law of contraries fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth my now-concluſion;
<q>Diſobedience againſt the commandements of the Lord, is a ſinne, which the Lord requireth to be eſchewed by euery child of his.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the illuſtration of this concluſion we are to note in man a twofold <hi>diſobedience;</hi> one in the <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>corruption,</hi> the other in the <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>regeneration. Diſobedience</hi> in man in the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:1736:283"/> 
                     <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>corruption,</hi> is an euill qualitie inbred in him by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby he is made of himſelfe altogether vnable and vnwilling to liue in ſubiection vnto God, to heare his voice to obey his will, or to doe what he commandeth. By this diſobedience man is not able to doe any thing, but <hi>hate</hi> God, his word, his will, and whatſoeuer is pleaſing to him. He euer rebels againſt God, he euer reſiſteth the will of God, he euer deſpiſeth the commandements of God, and embraceth with all his might what God forbiddeth.</p>
                  <p>How great this <hi>diſobedience</hi> is, the holy <hi>Scripture</hi> doth euidently demonſtrate, when it deſcribeth the nature of man, his thoughts, his counſailes, his affections, his deſires, his actions in the <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>corruption,</hi> and before his <hi>regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> So it calls vs<note n="k" place="margin">

                  <p>THat theſe words are an exprobation, an vpbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or twiting of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with the fouleneſſe of their ingratitude, I ſignified in my laſt exerciſe out of this place.

                     <hi>I ſent them not, neither haue I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them,</hi> neither <hi>ſpake I vnto them,</hi> yet <hi>they prophecie:</hi>
                     <pb n="306" facs="tcp:1736:291"/> and <hi>chap.</hi> 23.21. <hi>I ſent them not, yet they ranne, I ſpake not to them, yet they prophecied.</hi> Of the ſecond ſort, were thoſe Prophets in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom <hi>men choſe,</hi> but <hi>God called not.</hi> Of ſuch ſome would haue theſe words, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.8. to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, <hi>The Prophet is the ſnare of a fowler in all his wayes, and hatred in the houſe of his God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In oppoſition to theſe, there are of <hi>true Prophets</hi> two ſorts alſo. Both of them are <hi>lawfully</hi> called to their holy fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; ſome by <hi>God</hi> alone, ſome by <hi>God and man.</hi> The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Prophets</hi> in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and the bleſſed <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the <hi>New,</hi> had their calling from <hi>God</hi> alone: but <hi>Timothie, Titus,</hi> and the ſeauen <hi>Deacons,</hi> and the reſidue of religious and godly <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Paſtors</hi> of the Church, had and haue their calling, both from <hi>God and man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This diſtinction thus giuen, it is now eaſie to define, who the <hi>Prophets</hi> are, that are meant in my text. They are <hi>true Prophets,</hi> ſuch as had their calling immediatly <hi>from God,</hi> and <hi>from him alone:</hi> euen thoſe <hi>holy men of God,</hi> who liued in the time of the <hi>old Teſtament;</hi> ſome of which had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to be the bleſſed pen-men thereof. Such were the <hi>Prophets,</hi> whom the <hi>Iſraelites commanded, ſaying, Prophecie not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prophecie not]</hi> Speake not any more vnto vs in the name of the Lord. What? No more! Can there be any one ſo execrably audacious, as vtterly to forbid the paſſage of the <hi>word of God?</hi> any forhead ſo braſen, as ſimply and preciſely to <hi>reiect it?</hi> Its not to be imagined. The moſt wicked dare not doe it. Yet would they by their wills haue leſſe libertie of ſpeach permitted to <hi>Gods Prophets,</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and ſeruants: they would haue their tongues ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what tied, that they might not by their crying out againſt ſins, vex and gall their ſeared conſciences.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto we haue taken a view of the words. It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that we examine the matter conteined in them.</p>
                  <q>Yee commanded the Prophets, ſaying, Prophecie not.</q>

                  <p>Thus farre of the <hi>hatred</hi> of the <hi>wicked</hi> againſt the <hi>Godly,</hi> the true reaſon of my doctrine, which was:
<q>The wicked are euermore in a readineſſe, to doe all the diſgrace and deſpite they can, not onely to the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of the Lord, and his Miniſters, but alſo to the true ſeruants of God, of what vocation; eſtate, or condition ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they be.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let vs now make ſome vſe of that which hath beene hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto deliuered, for the bettering, and the amendment of our ſinfull liues.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Gods word, may from hence learne, not to take it vnto heart, if ſuch, as are bound by the Law of God and nature, and by all good order, to yeeld them due loue and reuerence, ſhall in pride and contempt inſult ouer them, to <hi>diſgrace and to deſpite them.</hi> They may well remember, that its neither <hi>great,</hi> nor <hi>new,</hi> nor <hi>rare</hi> thing, that they meete with ſuch courſe entertainement in the world; foraſmuch as they cannot be ignorant, that the <hi>world hateth them.</hi> And what if the <hi>world hate them!</hi> Shall they therefore be altogether dejected? They need not. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> giues them encouragement and comfort, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 15.18. <hi>If the world hate you, yee know that it hated me before it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The argument is drawen <hi>ab exemplo,</hi> from Chriſts owne example. <hi>The world hateth mee,</hi> you know it to be ſo, you ſee it. It needes not then to be any diſparagement to you if <hi>it hate you,</hi> it hated me <hi>before it hated you. Cur ergo ſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum, ſupra verticem extollit?</hi> S. <hi>Auſtine</hi> propounds the queſtion <hi>Tract.</hi> 88. <hi>in Iohannem.</hi> Why doth a member ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll it ſelfe aboue the head? <hi>Recuſas eſſe in corpore, ſi non vis odium mundi ſustinere cum capite:</hi> thou refuſeſt to be in the <hi>bodie,</hi> if thou wilt not with the <hi>head</hi> ſuſteine the <hi>hatred of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſecond argument of encouragement and comfort to
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:1736:295"/> vs againſt the hatred of the world; is drawne from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the world, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. <hi>If ye were of the world the world would loue his owne: but becauſe ye are not of the world, but I haue choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi> This argument is euident euen to the common ſenſe of men; who cannot but know, that betweene contraries there is no agreement, and betweene men of vnlike qualities, no full conſent of minds. It is then as if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had thus ſaid: <hi>The world loues</hi> none but <hi>his owne;</hi> none but thoſe that are addicted, deuoted, and wholy giuen ouer to it: but you <hi>are not of the world;</hi> therefore it loues not you. You <hi>are not of the world;</hi> for you are mine; and<note n="i" place="margin">

                     <hi>I am not of the world.</hi> I haue ſeparated you from the ſeruice of the world, to doe me ſeruice; and therefore the <hi>world hateth you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third argument of encouragement and comfort to vs, is <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>Remember the word, that I ſaid vnto you: The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant is not greater then the Lord: if they haue perſecuted me, they will alſo perſecute you.</hi> This argument is like the firſt: Its drawne from <hi>Christs</hi> owne example, as that was. All the difference is: the firſt ſpecifieth the <hi>hatred</hi> of the world; this the <hi>effect</hi> of that hatred, <hi>Perſecution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus ſtands the argument. The world <hi>perſecuteth</hi> me; you are my witneſſes it doth ſo. Thinke it not much then, if it alſo <hi>perſecute</hi> you. <hi>Remember the word that I ſaid vnto you;</hi> The<note n="k" place="margin">

                  <p>I conclude the firſt vſe: Let the <hi>wicked</hi> fret, and fume, and ſtamp, and ſtare, and grudge, and murmure againſt vs, let them forbid vs to <hi>prophecie,</hi> let them refuſe to <hi>heare vs,</hi> let them lay vpon vs <hi>all the diſgrace and despite they can;</hi> yet will we poſſeſſe our ſoules in patience, knowing it to be a faithfull ſaying, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.11.12. that, <hi>if we die with Chriſt, we ſhall alſo liue with him,</hi> and <hi>if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo raigne</hi> with him.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond vſe is for all other the true ſeruants of God, of what vocation, condition, or eſtate ſoeuer they be: for as much as the wicked lie in waite for them alſo, to <hi>doe them all the diſgrace and deſpite they can,</hi> as hath already bin proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto you. The vſe is to admoniſh you, that ye take it not to heart, if they, who are bound by the law of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>nature,</hi> by the bond of <hi>neighbour-hood,</hi> and <hi>our Chriſtian profeſſion,</hi> to loue you, and to tender your good, ſhall in pride and contempt inſult ouer you, <hi>to diſgrace and to deſpite you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The arguments for your encouragement and comfort in ſuch a caſe, may be the ſame with thoſe, which I but euen now produced for the encouragement and comfort of our ſelues in the like: will you haue them ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>med vp vnto you? Then thus.</p>
                  <p>You find but courſe reſpect and entertainement in the world, becauſe the world <hi>hateth you.</hi> It <hi>hateth you.</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile not at it, nor feare it. For firſt it <hi>hated</hi> Chriſt, before it <hi>hated you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the world <hi>would loue you,</hi> if you were <hi>his owne.</hi>
                     <pb n="317" facs="tcp:1736:296"/> But you are not. You <hi>are not of the world,</hi> and therefore the <hi>world hateth you.</hi> Be of good comfort: you <hi>are not of the world,</hi> for Chriſt hath <hi>choſen you out of the world,</hi> to be his beloued.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the world from <hi>hating</hi> you proceedeth to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute</hi> you. Let not this diſcourage you. For it <hi>perſecuted</hi> Chriſt firſt. They haue <hi>perſecuted</hi> Chriſt, and therefore will they <hi>perſecute</hi> you.<note n="r" place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 10.25.</note> 
                     <hi>It is enough for the Diſciple, that he be as his Maſter, and the ſeruant as the Lord.

                     <hi>When he was reviled, he reviled not againe; when he ſuffered, he threatned not; but committed his cauſe to him, that iudgeth righteouſly.</hi> Here is matter worthy our imitation.</p>
                  <p>The reſolued <hi>Chriſtian</hi> herevpon thus ſweetly medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. Shall Chriſt <hi>lie in the manger,</hi> and we ruffle it out <hi>in our palaces?</hi> Shall he mourne <hi>in ſackcloth,</hi> and wee bath <hi>in pleaſure?</hi> Shall he fighting in our defence, <hi>be wounded and crucified among theeues;</hi> and ſhall we <hi>diſport</hi> and <hi>ſolace</hi> our ſelues with fond and vaine delights? Shall he bee <hi>pierced through</hi> with the ſword of Gods iuſtice for our ſins, and ſhall we be vnwilling <hi>to ſuffer any thing for our ſelues?</hi> This were too-too vnnaturall and vnkinde.</p>
                  <p>Let not therefore the <hi>croſſe aduentures</hi> that may betide vs, diſmay vs: Let not the <hi>crueltie</hi> of our enemies, the <hi>ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> of our miſeries, the <hi>continuance</hi> of our afflictions, daunt vs: but let vs (following the aduiſe of <hi>S. Peter</hi> 1. <hi>Ep. chap.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 13.) Let vs <hi>reioyce, in as much as we are partakers of Chriſts ſufferings.</hi> So <hi>when his glory ſhall be reuealed,</hi> we ſhall be <hi>glad alſo with exceeding ioy.</hi> Thus much of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond vſe.</p>
                  <p>A third followeth. You remember the doctrine.</p>
                  <q>The wicked are euermore in a readineſſe, to doe all the diſgrace and deſpite they can, not onely to the true Prophets of the Lord and his Miniſters, but alſo to all
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:1736:297"/> other, the true ſeruants of God, of what vocation, eſtate, or condition ſoeuer they be.</q>
                  <p>The vſe is, to reproue thoſe, who eſteeme not aright of the ſufferings of the godly. Let a godly man be <hi>humbled</hi> vnder the croſſe, let him feele the hand of God vpon him; how will ſome wonder at him, as at a<note n="u" place="margin">

                  <p>Did not <hi>Eliphaz</hi> deale ſo with <hi>Iob?</hi> From the <hi>afflictions,</hi> the <hi>miſeries,</hi> the <hi>calamities,</hi> that <hi>Iob</hi> ſuffered, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, that <hi>Iob</hi> is no innocent man, no righteous man, but a deepe diſſembler, and a hollow-hearted hypocrite. His cenſure of <hi>Iob</hi> you may finde <hi>chap.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Remember I pray thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eliphaz</hi> to <hi>Iob,</hi> Remember I pray thee, <hi>who euer periſhed being innocent?</hi> Or <hi>where were the righteous cut off?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Who euer periſhed being innocent?</hi> Or <hi>where were the righteous cut off?</hi> It was <hi>Eliphaz</hi> his error, to collect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Iob</hi> was afflicted, and that moſt grieuouſly, that therefore he was <hi>to periſh,</hi> or to be <hi>cut off vtterly.</hi> God ſuffereth not his elect children, ſuch as <hi>Iob</hi> was, <hi>vtterly to periſh,</hi> or <hi>to be cut off.</hi> He <hi>afflicteth</hi> them, but with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to deliuer them; his <hi>hand</hi> is ſometimes vpon them, but it is for their good, not for their ruine. For albeit they may ſeeme to vs <hi>to periſh,</hi> when in the <hi>fire</hi> of their calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and trials, they are ſurpriſed by death, yet they <hi>periſh not;</hi> the <hi>Lord,</hi> he receiues them into his glory, and to a more happy life.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore to <hi>Eliphaz</hi> his queſtion, <hi>Who euer periſhed being innocent?</hi> Or <hi>where were the righteous cut off?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; If <hi>Eliphaz</hi> take the words of <hi>periſhing,</hi> and <hi>cutting off,</hi> in the ſtrict ſenſe and properly, I anſwer, <hi>neuer did the innocent periſh,</hi> neuer was <hi>any righteous man cut off.</hi> But if he take the words in a larger ſenſe for <hi>wallowing in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie,</hi>
                     <pb n="319" facs="tcp:1736:297"/> or <hi>lying in affliction;</hi> my anſwer then, is the ſame that <hi>S.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Si nullus innocens periret,</hi> if no man ſhould periſh, that is innocent, why ſhould the Prophet <hi>Eſai</hi> ſay, <hi>chap.</hi> 57.1. <hi>The righteous periſheth, and no man layeth it to heart! Si rectos, Deus providendo non raperet,</hi> if God in his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhould not take away any righteous man, why ſhould the wiſe man, <hi>chap.</hi> 4.11. ſay, The righteous was <hi>ſpeedily taken away,</hi> leſt that <hi>wickedneſſe ſhould alter his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> or <hi>deceit beguile his ſoule?

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, dearely beloued, ſith it may in ſome ſenſe bee truely ſaid of the man that is <hi>innocent,</hi> that he <hi>periſheth;</hi> and of the <hi>righteous</hi> man, that he is <hi>puniſhed,</hi> is <hi>taken away,</hi> is <hi>cut off;</hi> and of the <hi>faithfull</hi> of Gods houſe, that <hi>iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt begin</hi> with them: let it euer bee our care to <hi>eſteeme aright</hi> of the <hi>afflictions</hi> of our neighbours, and to <hi>iudge of them,</hi> with a righteous iudgment. Though they be <hi>iudged,</hi> be <hi>plagued,</hi> be <hi>ſmitten</hi> of God, it is not for vs ſlightly to regard them, to deſpiſe them, or to hide our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from them: it is our parts rather to haue a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling and a tender compaſſion of their tryals.</p>
                  <p>It were an vnchriſtian, an vncharitable, yea a helliſh conceit, thus to inferre: <hi>My neighbour,</hi> ſuch a man, or ſuch a man, <hi>is exerciſed vnder the Croſſe,</hi> and is <hi>ſenſible of the ſcourge of God vpon him,</hi> therefore <hi>he is in Gods disfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and a very grieuous ſinner.</hi> No ſuch inference is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable in <hi>Chriſts ſchole.</hi> In his <hi>ſchole,</hi> theſe Maximes paſſe for good.

                  <p>VVE are now come to the fourth part of this firſt Sermon of <hi>Amos,</hi> concerning the kingdome of the <hi>tenne tribes</hi> of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi> I heretofore called it a <hi>Commination.</hi> So I call it ſtill. For here are the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> threatned with puniſhment for the enormitie of their ſinnes, expreſſed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7, 8. and for the fouleneſſe of their ingratitude, layd to their charge, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. In this <hi>Commination</hi> we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, how the <hi>Lord,</hi> in reſpect of the ſinnes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and of their vnthankfulneſſe for benefits beſtowed on them, eſteemeth of them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. <hi>Behold, I am preſſed vnder you as a Cart is preſſed, that is full of ſheaues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other is, a menacing or threatning of puniſhment to befall them: I may terme it, <hi>A ſending of defiance</hi> vnto them; a <hi>denouncing of warre</hi> againſt them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, 15, 16.
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:1736:299"/> Wherein we may note three things.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, <hi>impotentia fugiendi,</hi> their vnableneſſe to eſcape the flight in the day of battell: thus ſet downe in the 14. <hi>verſ. The flight ſhall periſh from the ſwift.</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. thus: <hi>He that is ſwift of foote, ſhall not deliuer himſelfe: neither ſhall he that rideth the horſe deliuer himſelfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, <hi>Debilitas in reſiſtendo,</hi> their weakeneſſe in reſiſting the enemie thus ſet downe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>The ſtrong ſhall not ſtrengthen his force, neither ſhall the mightie deliuer himſelfe,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. thus: <hi>Neither ſhall he ſtand that hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the bow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third is, <hi>Fugae fortium:</hi> the flight of the valiant, and ſtout of heart, ſet downe in the laſt verſe, and there ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the adiunct of nakedneſſe: <hi>He that is couragious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the mightie, ſhall flee away naked in that day.</hi> Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the confirmation of all, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>My meditations for this time will be confined within the limits of the 13. <hi>verſ.

                  <p>Behold.</p>
                  <p>THis particle, ſet in the front of this verſe, is as it were a watchword to ſtirre vp our attentions, for as much as we are to heare of ſome important matter.

                     <hi>Behold, behold them,</hi> or <hi>behold theſe things, and I will giue to</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>one that bringeth good tydings.</hi> The place I vnderſtand of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is <hi>Alpha,</hi> or <hi>primus,</hi> the <hi>firſt;</hi> and <hi>Euangeliſta,</hi> he that bringeth the good tydings: him God giueth to <hi>Sion,</hi> and to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and in him, <hi>Ecce ecce iſta erunt:</hi> Behold, <hi>behold</hi> all the promiſes of God ſhall come to paſſe, and that ſpeedily.

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Ecce, Behold,</hi> is a note of aſſeueration, or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie, and is put for <hi>Sanè</hi> or <hi>Certè,</hi> verily or certainly.

Behold</hi> I will doe it; I will ſurely doe it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Ecce, Behold,</hi> is a particle, ordinarily vſed by God in his Comminations, when he threatneth ſome great and heauie puniſhment to come as <hi>Ezech.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Thus ſayth the Lord</hi> againſt Ieruſalem, <hi>Behold, I, euen I am againſt thee, and will execute iudgments in the midſt of thee, in the ſight of the Nations,</hi> And, <hi>chap.</hi> 6.3. Thus ſaith the <hi>Lord</hi> againſt <hi>Iſrael, Behold, I,</hi> euen <hi>I, will bring a ſword vpon you, and I will deſtroy your high places.</hi> And againſt <hi>Tyrus, chap.</hi> 26.3. Behold, <hi>I am againſt thee,</hi> O Tyrus, <hi>and will cauſe many Nations to come vp againſt thee, as the Sea cauſeth his waues to come vp.</hi> And againſt <hi>Zidon, chap.</hi> 28.22.

Behold, <hi>I am againſt thee,</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, <hi>King of Egypt, I will put hookes in thy Iawes.</hi> Many other like places I might alledge yet farther, to ſhew vnto you, the frequent vſe of this particle, <hi>Ecce, Behold,</hi> in the Comminations of Gods puniſhments. But I will not hold
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:1736:300"/> you any longer with this diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>Sufficient ſhall it be for you at this time to bee aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that as often as you meete with this word <hi>Ecce, Behold,</hi> in the ſacred Volume of the word of God; ſo often you haue a <hi>watch-word,</hi> to ſtirre vp your attention, to liſten to the matter that enſueth, for its weight and worth.

                  <p>With this expoſition of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> agreeth that of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie the great, Moral.</hi> 32.6. Who there takes theſe words of my text to intimate, that God vnder the burden of ſins

<q>Our ſinnes are ſometimes burdenſome and grieuous vnto God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such were the ſinnes of the old world, we know it by, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5, 6. For <hi>God ſaw, that the wickedneſſe of man was great in the earth, and that euery imagination of the thoughts of his heart was onely euill continually. And it repented the Lord, that he had made man on the earth, and it grieued him at his heart.</hi> It repented him, and grieued him at his heart.</p>
                  <p>Such were the ſinnes of <hi>Iudah.</hi> We know it by the firſt Chapter of the Prophecie of <hi>Eſai.</hi> The complaints which God maketh there, doe prooue it: <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>How is the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Citie become an Harlot? It was full of iudgement, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe lodged in it; but now murtherers. Thy ſiluer is become droſſe, thy wine is mixt with water. Thy Princes are rebellious, and companions of theeues: Euery one loueth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they iudge not the fatherleſſe, neither doth the cauſe of the widow come vnto them.</hi> And verſe 14. <hi>Your new moones, and your appointed feaſts, my ſoule hateth, they are a trouble vnto me, I am weary to beare them.</hi> You ſee; the ſins of <hi>Iudah</hi> were a trouble vnto God, he was <hi>weary to beare them.</hi> They were <hi>burdenſome</hi> and <hi>grieuous</hi> vnto him.</p>
                  <p>Such were the ſinnes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> we know it by the 43. <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>Eſai.</hi> There verſe 24. thus ſaith the <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>Iſrael: Thou haſt made me to ſerue with thy ſinnes; thou haſt wearied me with thine iniquities.</hi> What!

                  <p>Thus haue you my doctrine, and the vſes thereof. My doctrine was: <hi>Our ſinnes are ſometimes burdenſome and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous vnto God.</hi> My firſt vſe was; an incitement to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of ſinne in generall.

                     <hi>Complaints,</hi> we know, are the witneſſes of a <hi>burdened,</hi> and <hi>grieued</hi> ſoule. God here <hi>complaineth</hi> of preſſure, that he is <hi>preſſed</hi> vnder Iſraell, <hi>as a Cart is preſſed, that is full of ſheaues:</hi> from whence the collection is, that the ſinnes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are <hi>burdenſome</hi> and <hi>grieuous</hi> vnto God. But can this be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed? Can our <hi>ſinnes</hi> be <hi>burdenſome</hi> vnto God? Can they be <hi>grieuous</hi> vnto him? or can God <hi>complaine</hi> that they are ſuch?

                  <p>Will you, that I ſpeake properly, without a figure?

If ſome could haue reached him, it had gone ill with him long ere this. But <hi>God cannot ſuffer.</hi> So
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:1736:304"/> true is that axiome of the Schooles: <hi>No paſſion can befall the Deitie.

                  <p>Thus haue you my anſwere to the queſtion euen now propounded. The queſtion was: <hi>How God may be ſayd to complaine of our ſinnes, to be burdened with them, or to be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at them, ſith in himſelfe he hath all pleaſure and content?</hi> My anſwere is, <hi>He cannot be ſaid ſo to doe in a proper ſenſe and vnderſtanding,</hi> becauſe God is not obnoxious to any paſſion, but <hi>improperly, in a figure, abuſiuely, metaphorically, by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropopathic, and metonymically, he may well be ſayd ſo to doe:</hi> he may well be ſayd to <hi>complaine</hi> of our ſinnes, to be <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened</hi> with them, and to be <hi>grieued</hi> at them. So he <hi>complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth</hi> againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> here in my text; <hi>I am preſſed vnder you, as a Cart is preſſed that is full of ſheaues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto haue I ſtood vpon the firſt Interpretation of theſe words, depending vpon the <hi>intranſitiue</hi> or <hi>newtrall ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification</hi> of the Hebrew <hi>verbe</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

<q>I will preſſe your place, as a Cart full of ſheaues preſſeth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the very reading of <hi>Tremellius</hi> and <hi>Iunius. Ionathan</hi> doth not much varie from it; nor <hi>R. Abraham,</hi> and other
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:1736:305"/> Hebrew Doctors, nor the wiſe men of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as <hi>Pagnine</hi> hath obſerued.

                  <p>In an old Engliſh Bible, It may be <hi>Taverners</hi> tranſlation) I find this place thus Interpreted; <hi>I will craſhe you in ſunder, like as a wayne craſheth, that is full of ſheaues.</hi> I will <hi>craſh you,</hi> or, I will <hi>preſſe you:</hi> the meaning is the ſame: and thus I pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe it,</p>

                     <hi>I]</hi> the <hi>Lord, Iehovah,</hi> your Lord God, <hi>will preſſe your place,</hi> whereſoeuer it ſhall be; But how? Either <hi>as a cart full loaden with ſheaues preſſeth]</hi> the earth, and whatſoeuer elſe it paſſeth ouer; or <hi>as a cart full loaden preſſeth the ſheaues in the threſhing floare:</hi> or <hi>as a cart full loaden with ſheaues is it ſelfe preſſed.</hi> I will preſſe you, <hi>as a cart full of ſheaues preſſeth,</hi> or <hi>is preſſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this ſecond Interpretation of my text, my text is <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatorie.</hi> The Lord threatneth to puniſh <hi>Iſrael</hi> for their ſinnes; to puniſh them <hi>non levi manu, aut viribus languidis,</hi> not with a light hand, or languiſhing force, <hi>ſed magno niſu acrobore,</hi> but with great endeuour and ſtrength. <hi>I will preſſe you, as a cart full of ſheaues preſſeth,</hi> or is <hi>preſſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God euer iuſt, and immutable, aſſigneth to like ſinnes like puniſhments.

                  <p>For the further illuſtration of this truth, I might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſuffrages of the auncient; of <hi>Auſtine,</hi> and of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie.</hi> But hauing elſewhere done that in my 18.

                     <hi>fountaine?</hi> Yet may I not end, without making ſome vſe hereof.</p>
                  <p>My firſt vſe ſhall be, to reprooue ſuch as teach other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as <hi>Socinus Oſterodius, Gittichius,</hi> and other the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Chriſts ſatisfaction.</hi> They will thus argue: if God will neuer ſuffer ſinne <hi>to eſcape vnpuniſhed,</hi> then belike hee <hi>caſteth all men into Hell,</hi> there to be <hi>puniſhed</hi> with infernall torments.</p>
                  <p>I anſwere, No. <hi>Sed quoſdam infernalibus poenis punit, caete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris peccata remittit:</hi> Farre bee it from God, that he ſhould puniſh all, the <hi>Elect</hi> as well as the <hi>Reprobate,</hi> with infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall torments. Some, <hi>all the Reprobate,</hi> he ſo puniſheth: but to others, to <hi>all the Elect,</hi> he forgiues their ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Their reply here is: Doth God forgiue <hi>the Elect</hi> their ſinnes? Why then it is likely, he leaues them <hi>altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our anſwere is: Not ſo. God doth not leaue the ſinnes of the <hi>Elect altogether vnpuniſhed;</hi> but doth <hi>puniſh</hi> them all, by <hi>tranſlating</hi> their ſinnes from them, to his owne ſonne, <hi>Chriſt Ieſus:</hi> according to that, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.6.

                  <p>My ſecond Vſe is, a ſhort word of exhortation. Will not God ſuffer any ſinne to eſcape <hi>altogether vnpuniſhed?</hi> What then ſhall become of vs, beloued? Our ſinnes!

                  <p>From the firſt of theſe ſeauen miſeries thus expreſſed in this firſt branch, <hi>The flight ſhall periſh from the ſwift,</hi> we may take this leſſon,
<q>When God reſolueth to puniſh man for ſinne, there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge for him, no evaſion, no eſcaping by flight, though he be of a ſwift, an expedite, and an agile bodie.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This truth <hi>Albertus</hi> would ratifie with thoſe words, <hi>Prov.</hi> 92. <hi>Velox pedibus offendet.</hi> He that is ſwift of foote <hi>offendeth,</hi> ſtumbleth, hitteth againſt ſome ſtone, or ſtump, and ſo falleth, and is ouertaken. But the allegation is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent. The words are againſt <hi>raſh</hi> and <hi>vnaduiſed acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in the courſe of mans life; and doe beare with them
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:1736:309"/> this ſenſe: As he that runneth haſtily, if he looke not to his feete, that he may chuſe the good way, and leaue the bad, is in great danger of continuall falling: ſo he, that haſtily and without due deliberation goeth about this or that, may eaſily tranſgreſſe before he be aware. This ſenſe is naturall to the words, as we render them: <hi>He that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth with his feete, ſinneth.</hi> If thou runne haſtily to euill, thou ſinneſt againſt God and thine owne ſoule.</p>
                  <p>The other place alleaged by <hi>Albertus</hi> to proue, that there is no evaſion, no eſcaping for the <hi>ſwift,</hi> is more perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.

                  </p>
                  <p>As pertinent is that of the Preacher, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.11. <hi>There is no race to the ſwift,</hi> or, <hi>in running it helpeth not to be ſwift.</hi> The meaning of it the <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſe</hi> thus expreſſeth: though men be as <hi>ſwift</hi> as <hi>Eagles,</hi> yet ſhall they not <hi>by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> helpe themſelues, or deliuer themſelues from death in the day of battell.

                  </p>
                  <p>Not deliuer himſelfe! and yet <hi>ſwift of foote.</hi> It is euen ſo. Why may he not <hi>attempt</hi> to flee? Perchance he may: yet ſhall his <hi>attempt</hi> be fruſtrate: for thus ſaith the <hi>Lord, Amos</hi> 9.1. <hi>He, that fleeth, ſhall not flee away, and he that eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, ſhall not be deliuered.</hi> Yea, ſaith he, <hi>though they digge into Hell, thence ſhall mine hand take them: though they climbe vp to Heauen, thence will I bring them downe.</hi> And <hi>though they hide themſelues in the top of Carmel, I will ſearch and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my ſight in the bottome of the Sea, thence will I command the ſerpent and he ſhall bite them.</hi> And <hi>though they goe into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie before their enemies, thence will I command the ſword, and it ſhall ſlay them.</hi> In this <hi>Hyperbolicall</hi> exaggeration, (for ſuch it is in the iudgements of <hi>S.

<q>Its not the bow and arrowes, or ſword, or any other inſtrument of warre, that can any whit avayle vs, when God will puniſh.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For proofe hereof I produce the iudgement of God vpon <hi>Gog,</hi> the cheife Prince of <hi>Meſhech</hi> and <hi>Tubal, Ezech.</hi> 39.3. where thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, and I will ſmite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cauſe thine arrowes to fall out of thy right hand. Bow</hi> and arrowes! There is no helpe in them. None at all: nor in the <hi>ſword;</hi> nor in any other <hi>militarie engine.</hi> Therefore doth the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 44 6. renounce all truſt in them. His words are, <hi>I doe not truſt in my bow, neither can my ſword ſaue me.</hi> His <hi>bow</hi> and <hi>ſword,</hi> he doth not much care for. Wherein then is his truſt? It is in the might and ſtrength of God. <hi>Gods power</hi> was his <hi>buckler,</hi> whereto he truſted for his owne defence, and for the diſcomfiture of his enemies.</p>
                  <p>It is the Vſe we are to make of the doctrine now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. We muſt not repoſe our truſt in any externall helpe, the <hi>bow,</hi> the <hi>ſword,</hi> or the like, for this were indeed, to rob <hi>God</hi> of his glory, and to runne to the <hi>creature</hi> for helpe.

It conteineth menacings, or threats againſt the kingdome of the <hi>ten tribes,</hi> the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for the foulneſſe of their ingratitude. Theſe menacings or threats proceeding from him who onely is omnipotent, and al-ſufficient to effect what he threatneth, euen from the Lord, <hi>Iehovah,</hi> doe plainely demonſtrate, that Gods iudgements are ineluctable, not to be auoyded. If <hi>God</hi> will the puniſhment of any, there is no place for <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,</hi> no <hi>cuaſion,</hi> no meanes to eſcape.

Read if you will; the ſwift of foote <hi>ſhall not be ſaued,</hi> or, <hi>ſhall not eſcape,</hi> or, <hi>ſhall not deliuer himſelfe;</hi> you will forth-with vnderſtand, that, a man cannot <hi>by the ſwiftneſſe of his feete</hi> out-runne God. This is the very marrow of that leſſon, which we are to learne from hence. The leſſon is:
<q>The ſwift of foote hath no aduantage aboue others, for the ſauing of himſelfe, if God doe once reſolue to puniſh.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This agreeth with that which I haue obſerued vpon the firſt clauſe of the 14. <hi>verſe: The flight ſhall periſh from the ſwift.</hi> With that, this which we haue now in hand is coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. <hi>The flight ſhall periſh from the ſwift,</hi> and, <hi>The ſwift of foote ſhall not deliuer himſelfe;</hi> theſe two, to the vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are but one, and doe yeeld vnto vs one and the ſame obſeruation. The obſeruation is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When God reſolues to puniſh man for ſinne, there is no refuge
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:1736:318"/> for him, no euaſion, no eſcaping by flight, though he be of a ſwift, an expedite, and an agile bodie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This truth ſtands ratified with that in the ninth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Prophecie, verſ. 1. <hi>Non erit fuga eis, qui fugient, &amp; non ſalvabitur ex eis, qui fugerit.</hi> He that <hi>fleeth</hi> of them, ſhall not <hi>flee away;</hi> and he that <hi>eſcapeth</hi> of them ſhall not be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered.</hi> And with that <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.11. <hi>There is no race to the ſwift,</hi> or, <hi>In running it helpeth not to be ſwift:</hi> that is, as <hi>Ionathan</hi> expounds the place; Though men be as ſwift <hi>as Eagles,</hi> yet ſhall they not <hi>by running</hi> helpe themſelues, or deliuer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from death <hi>in the day of battell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The many euidences of holy Writ, which are vſually brought to proue, that <hi>God is euery where preſent,</hi> and <hi>in all places at once,</hi> may ſerue for a further ratification of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded doctrine. For if God <hi>be euery where preſent,</hi> if he be <hi>at once in all places,</hi> then certainely there is <hi>no refuge</hi> for man againſt him, no <hi>euaſion,</hi> no <hi>eſcaping</hi> by flight. Nor the <hi>caues</hi> of the earth, nor the <hi>ſecrets</hi> of walls, nor the <hi>darkeneſſe</hi> of the night, nor the <hi>diſtance</hi> of place by land or by ſea, can <hi>hide vs from his preſence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Can they not? How then may that be excuſed which we read of <hi>Adam</hi> and his wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.8. that they <hi>HID</hi> themſelues <hi>from the preſence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden?</hi> How that which we read of <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.16. that he went <hi>out from the preſence of the Lord?</hi> How that which we read of <hi>Ionah, chap.</hi> 1.3. that he, when he was ſent to <hi>Ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe ſcruples I am now to remoue: The firſt concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <hi>Adam</hi> and his wife, their <hi>hiding</hi> themſelues among the trees of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> Some ſay; <hi>Adam</hi> hid himſelfe through feare, not as if he could <hi>flee from God,</hi> but becauſe hee thought himſelfe vnworthie <hi>to come into Gods</hi> ſight. So <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus lib.</hi> 3 <hi>adverſus haereſes cap.</hi> 37. He ſeemes to take in good part this flight of <hi>Adam,</hi> and his endeuour to <hi>hide</hi> himſelfe, as if it proceeded from a pious and profitable feare and dread of an humble and repentant ſoule.</p>
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:1736:318"/>
                  <p>Other ſay, that <hi>Adam</hi> exceedingly troubled in mind, much aſhamed and afraid, that he had tranſgreſſed the commandement of God, like vnto a mad man, that knows not which way to turne himſelfe, went about to <hi>hide</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. So S. <hi>Auſtine lib.</hi> 11. <hi>de Geneſi ad literam cap.</hi> 33.</p>
                  <p>A third opinion there is, that taxeth <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> of infidelitie and impenitencie, for <hi>hiding</hi> of themſelues: as if guiltie of tranſgreſſion, they had thought ſimply to <hi>hide</hi> themſelues from the preſence of God. Of this opinion I find <hi>Rupertus,</hi> who <hi>Comment. in Geneſin lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. thus expreſſeth himſelfe. <hi>Abſcondendo ſe, vter<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> de Deo malè ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, &amp; ſibi inſipienter providit, tanquam impaenitens, tanquam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelis. Adam</hi> and his wife in hiding themſelues thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe concerning God, and prouided fooliſhly for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as if they had beene impenitent and vnbeleeuing.</p>
                  <p>It is no ill or idle opinion, to ſay that, Perhaps <hi>Adam</hi> and his <hi>wife,</hi> for want of experience (for they had neuer fallen before) might thinke, that by running among the trees of Paradiſe they might <hi>hide</hi> themſelues. But when God had once found them out (and quickly he found them out) they could not any longer ſo thinke. Then they could not but be reſolued vpon this; that there is no <hi>fleeing away,</hi> no <hi>hiding</hi> of our ſelues from <hi>the preſence of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus is the firſt ſcruple remoued. <hi>Adam</hi> and his <hi>wife</hi> hid themſelues <hi>from the preſence of the Lord God among the trees of a garden.</hi> They <hi>hid</hi> themſelues, that is, they <hi>would haue hid</hi> themſelues, they <hi>would</hi> but <hi>could</hi> not.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſcruple, concerneth <hi>Caine</hi> his going out <hi>from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> If <hi>Cain</hi> could <hi>goe out</hi> from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, how is the <hi>Lord euery where preſent?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For anſwere hereunto we are to note, that the <hi>preſence</hi> of God doth ſometime in holy Scripture betoken the place of his preſence; the place where God was firſt worſhipped by ſacrifice, and ſhewed viſible ſignes of his <hi>preſence:</hi> And that it doth ſometime ſignifie the <hi>grace</hi> of God, his <hi>fauour,</hi> his <hi>care,</hi> his <hi>prouidence,</hi> and <hi>protection.</hi> In both theſe reſpects may <hi>Cain</hi> be ſaid to haue gone out <hi>from the preſence of the
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:1736:319"/> Lord.</hi> For firſt he was expelled from the land of his natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, from that land where God was wont to ſhew his face, and vnder the viſible forme of humane nature, to talke with man familiarly: and ſecondly he was excluded from Gods <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>fauour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much doth <hi>Cain</hi> himſelfe confeſſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Behold, thou haſt driuen me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face ſhall I be hid,</hi> and I <hi>ſhall be a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiue and a vagabond in the earth.</hi> Thou haſt <hi>driuen me out this day from the face of the earth,</hi> that is, Thou expelleſt me from my natiue ſoyle, which to me is moſt deare &amp; ſweete, wherein I was borne, haue beene bred vp, and haue liued with my parents and kinſ-folke euen vnto this day: thou <hi>driueſt me out</hi> from a moſt fruitfull and pleaſant <hi>land,</hi> a <hi>land,</hi> that is next to the Paradiſe of the earth; a <hi>land,</hi> which thou haſt conſecrated to thy ſelfe, to be the land of thy ſacrifices oblations, and holy worſhip; a <hi>land</hi> wherein thou art wont to manifeſt thy ſelfe vnto men, and to inſtruct them by thy ſacred oracles, and anſwers. From this <hi>land,</hi> the land of my natiuitie, thou <hi>driueſt me out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And from thy face ſhall I be hid]</hi> I ſhall for euer and euery where, find thee diſpleaſed with me, angry at me, and mine enemy, to the intollerable horrour and amazement of my minde: thou wilt not deigne to looke vpon me with the eyes of thy mercie, but wilt for euer hide thy face from me, and ſo depriue me of thy ſingular beneuolence, care, tutele and protection. So was <hi>Cain</hi> hid from the <hi>face of the Lord,</hi> and ſo <hi>went he out from his preſence.</hi> Otherwiſe hee could not be <hi>hid,</hi> he would not <hi>goe out</hi> from the preſence of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>The third ſcruple concerneth <hi>Ionah</hi> his fleeing to <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiſh.</hi> from the <hi>preſence</hi> of the Lord. If <hi>Ionah</hi> could flee to <hi>Tarſhiſh</hi> from the preſence of the Lord, how is the Lord <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where preſent?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of this fleeing of <hi>Ionah</hi> from the preſence of the Lord, there is a twofold vnderſtanding. Some thus vnderſtand it; that he left the whole border and ground of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> where
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:1736:319"/> the <hi>preſence of the Lord,</hi> though it were not more then in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, was yet more euident by the <hi>manifeſtations</hi> of his fauours and graces towards them. There was the <hi>arke</hi> of the <hi>couenant,</hi> and the <hi>ſanctuary,</hi> there the <hi>Lord</hi> gaue them anſwere by <hi>dreames,</hi> and <hi>oracles:</hi> there were other more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall fauours of the Lords abode there.</p>
                  <p>Others by this fleeing of <hi>Ionah</hi> from the preſence of the <hi>Lord,</hi> doe vnderſtand his turning his backe vpon the <hi>Lord,</hi> his ſhaking off the yoke of the <hi>Lord,</hi> his wilfull renouncing the Commandement of the <hi>Lord;</hi> his departing from his dutie and from the execution of his office, enioyned him by the Lord.</p>
                  <p>In the language of the Scripture, they are ſaid <hi>to be in the Lords preſence,</hi> or to <hi>ſtand before the Lord,</hi> who doe carefully attend his pleaſure, and are readie to receiue and execute whatſoeuer he impoſeth. In the 10. of <hi>Deut. verſ.</hi> 8. The Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> is ſeparated by the Lord, <hi>to ſtand before the Lord. To ſtand before the Lord,</hi> that is, as it is there expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>to miniſter vnto the Lord, and to bleſſe in his name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So is the phraſe vſed by <hi>Elias,</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 17.1. Where thus ſaith he, vnto <hi>Ahab: As the Lord God of</hi> Iſraell <hi>liueth, before whom I stand, there ſhall not be dew nor raine theſe yeares, but according to my word.</hi> The Lord God, <hi>before whom I ſtand;</hi> that is, the Lord God, whom faithfully I doe ſerue. And ſo is it by <hi>Elizeus</hi> in thoſe his words to <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian.</hi> 2. King. 5.16. <hi>As the Lord liueth</hi> before whom I ſtand, <hi>I will receiue no bleſſing of thee.</hi> As the Lord liueth <hi>before whom I ſtand,</hi> a witneſſe to my actions, the ſearcher of my heart, whoſe honour and ſeruice I tender more then mine owne gaine, I will receiue no bleſſing, no reward of thee.</p>
                  <p>Now if they, who duely ſerue the Lord, are ſaid <hi>to ſtand before the Lord,</hi> and <hi>to be in his preſence,</hi> then may they who caſt off the yoke of the ſeruice due vnto him, well be ſaid to <hi>hide themſelues from the face of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>to flee from his preſence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſee now what this phraſe of <hi>fleeing from the preſence of the Lord</hi> doth meane. It giues vs to vnderſtand, that <hi>Ionas,</hi>
                     <pb n="364" facs="tcp:1736:320"/> as a fugitiue and refractary ſeruant ranne <hi>from the Lord,</hi> breaking his bonds of dutie, and making no conſcience or care to <hi>doe him ſeruice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus are the ſcruples done away and my doctrine ſtands good,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is no refuge, no euaſion, no eſcaping, no hiding, no fleeing from the face of the Lord, from his preſence, from his iudgments,</hi> no <hi>not for the ſwift of foote.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well. What if the <hi>footman</hi> for all his <hi>ſwiftneſſe</hi> cannot ſaue himſelfe; fares it not better with the <hi>horſeman?</hi> Cannot he <hi>deliuer himſelfe?</hi> No. He cannot. He is diſabled in the next words,

                  </p>
                  <p>This is it, which you may read in the Booke of <hi>Prouerbs chap.</hi> 21.31. <hi>The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battell, but ſafetie is of the Lord.</hi> Let the <hi>horſe</hi> be made readie, let him be throughly furniſhed for the warre, yet relie not vpon him for thy ſafetie.

In the ſtrength of this conceit, furniſhing himſelfe with <hi>horſes</hi> and <hi>chariots</hi> of warre, <hi>ſix hundred chariots,</hi> and <hi>all the chariots of Egypt,</hi> accompanied with his <hi>nobles, captaines,</hi> and <hi>ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> he marched furiouſly and purſued the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> euen to the <hi>middeſt</hi> of the <hi>Red Sea:</hi> To the <hi>middest</hi> of that <hi>Sea</hi> they came, &amp; no one waue roſe vp againſt them, to wet ſo much as the hoofes of their <hi>horſes.</hi> When they were come <hi>ſo far</hi> (too farre to returne) they were ſodainely ſtriken with their laſt terrour. Their <hi>chariots</hi> and <hi>horſes,</hi> in which they truſted, fayled them, as hauing done them ſeruice enough, to carry them into perdition. For the <hi>Sea</hi> ſhut her mouth vpon them, and <hi>ſwallowed them vp in her waues:</hi> you know
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:1736:321"/> it to be ſo, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.26. Where is now the ſafetie, which they promiſed themſelues by their <hi>Horſes</hi> and <hi>Chariots?</hi> I muſt againe ſay, <hi>Mendax equus ad ſalutem,</hi> A horſe is a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing for <hi>ſafetie,</hi> a vaine thing <hi>to ſaue</hi> a man. Thus is my doctrine confirmed;
<q>He that is mounted on horſebacke, hath no aduantage aboue others, for the ſauing of himſelfe, if God doe once reſolue to puniſh.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now let vs make ſome vſe of this doctrine. It may firſt ſerue for <hi>reproofe</hi> of ſuch, as for the time of warre doe glory in the multitude and ſtrength of their <hi>horſes,</hi> and preſume that they ſhall preuaile and get the victory by the valour of their <hi>horſemen.</hi> The holy Scripture would haue them to be of an other minde, and to be perſwaded, that victory is euer <hi>from the Lord,</hi> and <hi>from him alone,</hi> and that without him the <hi>horſe</hi> and the <hi>rider</hi> can doe nothing. But they will not change their mind, they will not be thus perſwaded. To theſe therefore thus ſaith the <hi>Lord God,</hi> the <hi>holy one of Iſrael, Eſa.</hi> 30.15. <hi>In returning and reſt ſhall yee be ſaued,</hi> in <hi>quietnes and confidence, ſhall be your ſtrength; and ye would not.</hi> But ye ſaid; <hi>No, for we will flee vpon horſes, and will ride vpon the ſwift.</hi> Will you <hi>flee vpon horſes?</hi> therefore ſhall <hi>yee flee.</hi> Will ye <hi>ride</hi> vpon the <hi>ſwift?</hi> therefore ſhall they that purſue you be <hi>ſwift.</hi> A <hi>thouſand</hi> of you ſhall flee at the rebuke of <hi>one:</hi> or at the moſt <hi>at the rebuke of fiue</hi> ſhall ye flee <hi>till yee be left as a beacon vpon the top of a mountaine, and as an enſigne on a hill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againſt theſe there is a curſe gone forth, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 31.1. <hi>Woe be vnto them that goe downe to</hi> Egypt <hi>for helpe, and truſt in</hi> horſes, <hi>and comfort themſelues with</hi> chariots, <hi>becauſe they are many; and with</hi> horſemen, <hi>becauſe they are luſtie and ſtrong: but looke not vnto the holy one of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>nor ſeeke the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning theſe I now ſay no more. I goe on with a ſecond vſe: and that is, to <hi>admoniſh</hi> our ſelues, that we put no truſt, no confidence in <hi>horſe, chariot, horſemen,</hi> or like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall meane for ſafetie. Sith it is euident, that theſe cannot deliuer vs, from any the leaſt iudgement, that God in his diſpleaſure ſhall lay vpon vs. Let vs for euer truſt in the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:1736:322"/> 
                     <hi>Lord</hi> alone, and his power. It is a ſweete ſtraine which the faithfull haue in their ſong, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.7. <hi>Hi, curruum, &amp; illi equorum; nos vero nominis Iehovae Dei noſtri recordamur.</hi> Let it be the matter of our meditation in the day of trouble and diſtreſſe. Say we in faith and a ſure hope; <hi>Some truſt in</hi> Chariots, <hi>and ſome in</hi> horſes, <hi>but we will remember the name of the Lord our God.</hi> We will remember him, to put our truſt in him, and to ſettle our hope on him alone. So ſhall a bleſſing attend vs. It is promiſed, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that truſteth in the Lord, and whoſe hope the Lord is.</hi> Bleſſed is he! What is that to ſay? It followeth: Hee ſhall be as a tree planted by the waters, that <hi>ſpreadeth out her rootes by the riuer,</hi> whom <hi>the heat,</hi> when it commeth, <hi>cannot hurt,</hi> whoſe <hi>leaues</hi> are alwayes <hi>greene,</hi> that is not carefull in the <hi>yeare of drought,</hi> and neuer ceaſeth <hi>from yeelding fruit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this compariſon betweene a <hi>faithfull man,</hi> that truſteth in the Lord, and a <hi>tree</hi> planted by the waters ſide, we may note the ſtedfaſtneſſe and ſtabilitie wherewith the faithfull people of God are ſupported, ſo, that they can neuer <hi>fall away</hi> from faith, and from the grace of God: whereby is condemned the doctrine of <hi>doubting,</hi> that Popiſh doctrine, very pernicious, yea, deadly to euery ſoule, that ſhall drinke it in. But I will not here make any excurſion. Let that which hath alreadie beene deliuered ſuffice for the explication of the 15. verſe. The ſixteenth followeth.</p>

                     <hi>hharom naked.</hi> A man is ſometimes ſaid to be <hi>naked,</hi> when he wanteth neceſſaries for the ſupply of preſent occaſions. It is ſaid of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.24. that he <hi>ſtript off his clothes,</hi> and <hi>prophecied,</hi> and <hi>was all that day and all that night naked.</hi> I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that <hi>Saul</hi> was indeed <hi>altogither naked,</hi> but he is ſaid to be ſo, becauſe he had <hi>laid aſide</hi> his princely robes; as <hi>R.

                  <p>In the ſecond of <hi>Samuel, chap.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Michal</hi> telleth <hi>Dauid,</hi> that he had vncouered himſelfe, or made himſelfe <hi>naked.</hi> And why? but becauſe he had put of his princely apparell, and danced in a linnen <hi>Ephod.</hi>

                     <hi>Naked</hi> alſo may they, be ſaid to be, that haue no good apparell, no good clothing on.

                  <p>By the places now alleaged you ſee, that he may be ſaid to be <hi>naked,</hi> that is not ſimply and altogither ſo.

                  <p>After that in the dayes of <hi>Hoſeah</hi> ſonne of <hi>Elah,</hi> the laſt of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> this prediction was fulfilled, at what time <hi>Salmanaſſer King</hi> of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> invaded <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the ten Tribes, tooke <hi>Samaria,</hi> and carried much people away into <hi>Aſſyria.</hi> Of this we read 2. <hi>King.</hi> 17.6.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>that day,</hi> that day when <hi>Tiglath Pileſar</hi> preuailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that day wherein <hi>Salmanaſſer</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, he that was <hi>couragious among the mighty,</hi> was faine no doubt <hi>to runne away,</hi> and that <hi>naked,</hi> according to this prediction, <hi>He that is couragious among the mighty, ſhall flee away naked in that day.</hi> My obſeruation from hence is this:
<q>It is not a ſtout courage, a valiant heart, or a bold ſpirit, <hi>that</hi> can ſteed a man in the day of Gods vengeance.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:1736:324"/>
                  <p>Beleeue it, it is not. For in <hi>that day,</hi> the ſtouteſt, the moſt valiant and bold, ſhall be ſtriken with <hi>aſtoniſhment of heart,</hi>

                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.28.29.</note> and ſhall grope at noone dayes, as the blind man doth in darkeneſſe. It ſhall then be with him, as it was with <hi>Belſhaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> the King, <hi>Daniel</hi> 5.6. <hi>His countenance ſhall bee changed,</hi> his <hi>thoughts ſhall trouble him,</hi> the <hi>ioynes of his loynes ſhall be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> and his <hi>knees ſhall ſmite one againſt the other.</hi> Yea then (for then will the <hi>Lord</hi> ariſe to <hi>ſhake terribly the earth</hi>) then ſhall he goe into the <hi>holes</hi> and <hi>clefts of the ragged rockes,</hi> and into the <hi>caues of the earth,</hi> for feare of <hi>the Lord, and for the glory of his Maieſtie.</hi> So ſaith <hi>Eſay</hi> elegantly, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.19, 21. And ſay you now, what can a <hi>ſtout courage,</hi> a valiant heart, a bold ſpirit ſteed a man in <hi>that day,</hi> in the day of Gods vengeance? You muſt needs confeſſe, it can ſteed him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>Nothing! Let vs then for our good make ſome profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vſe hereof. We ſhall the better make it if we will ſumme vp together thoſe naturall abilities, which our Prophet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> hath here diſabled, from yeelding any helpe vnto vs in the day of God his reuengement: If neither he that is <hi>of an expedite and agile bodie,</hi> nor the <hi>ſtrong man,</hi> nor the <hi>mightie man,</hi> nor the <hi>bow-man,</hi> nor the <hi>ſwift of foot,</hi> nor the <hi>horſeman,</hi> ſhall in <hi>that day</hi> be able to <hi>deliuer</hi> or helpe <hi>himſelfe:</hi> if he that is <hi>couragious among the mightie,</hi> ſhall be faine to <hi>runne away naked in that day,</hi> whence then ſhall we in <hi>that day</hi> looke for ſafetie? It muſt not be from any ayde of man.</p>
                  <p>Now the Vſe we are to make hereof is, that we truſt not in <hi>man,</hi> or in any thing that is in or about <hi>man.</hi> To this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie we are aduiſed by the Prophet <hi>Eſai,</hi> chap. 2.22. <hi>Ceaſe yee from</hi> man, <hi>whoſe breath is in his noſtrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of?</hi> If you will be ſafe and without danger in the day of trouble, <hi>Ceaſe from man;</hi> See that yee haue no <hi>confidence,</hi> no affiance in him, as though <hi>againſt</hi> God or <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> God he were able to <hi>helpe you.</hi> His <hi>breath is in his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils;</hi> his ſoule, his vitall ſpirit, his life is but a blaſt, and is gone with a puffe. Then <hi>where is his helpe?</hi> Weake, fraile, and brittle <hi>man,</hi> wherein <hi>is he to be accounted of?</hi> Is he to be
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:1736:325"/> 
                     <hi>accounted of</hi> for any thing that is in him? for his <hi>actiuitie,</hi> for his <hi>dexteritie,</hi> for his <hi>valour,</hi> for his <hi>wiſedome,</hi> or the like? No: for if he be <hi>gone,</hi> all theſe are likewiſe vaniſhed.</p>
                  <p>But may he not be accounted of for ſomewhat that is <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout</hi> him? for his <hi>riches,</hi> for his <hi>munition,</hi> and weapons of defence, for his <hi>honour,</hi> and the reputation he holdeth in the ſtate wherein thou liueſt? No, no. For what cares the <hi>Almightie</hi> for theſe? The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> was not ill aduiſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.3. Where he thus aduiſeth vs: <hi>Put not your truſt in</hi> Princes, <hi>nor in any ſonne of</hi> man, <hi>in whom there is no helpe, his breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth, in that very day his thoughts periſh.</hi> See <hi>man</hi> here pictured and drawne forth in liuely colours: <hi>Put not your truſt in Princes]</hi> not in <hi>Princes?</hi> Why? Is not their authoritie and pre-eminence here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great? Yes. But <hi>they are ſonnes of men]</hi> Well. Be it ſo. The <hi>ſonnes of men</hi> are creatures not farre inferiour to the <hi>Angels.</hi> True. But <hi>there is no helpe in them]</hi> no helpe in them? Why ſo? <hi>Their breath goeth forth]</hi> They <hi>dye.</hi> What if they <hi>dye?</hi> Is there no place for them in Heauen among the ſtarres? No, they <hi>returne to their earth]</hi> there to participate with rottenneſſe and corruption. What if corruption be in their fleſh, may not their intendments and deuiſes be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized and kept for eternitie? No, they may not. For <hi>in that very day their thoughts periſh]</hi> their <hi>thoughts</hi> are as tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitorie as their bodies, and come to nought. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>put not your truſt</hi> in them; not <hi>in Princes,</hi> nor <hi>in any ſon of man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherein then ſhall we put our truſt? Euen <hi>in the Lord our God.</hi> To this truſt in the <hi>Lord,</hi> we are inuited, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.8, 9. <hi>It is botter to truſt in the</hi> Lord <hi>then to put confidence in</hi> man. <hi>It is better to truſt in the</hi> Lord, <hi>then to put confidence in</hi> Princes. Is one <hi>better</hi> then the other? Why, then both may be <hi>good,</hi> and it may be <hi>good</hi> to put confidence in man. Not ſo. You may not take the word <hi>better</hi> in this place to be ſo ſpoken. For if you put <hi>any confidence in man,</hi> you rob God of his glory; which to doe can neuer be <hi>good.</hi> I therefore thus expound the words: <hi>It is better]</hi> by infinite degrees,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:1736:325"/> abſolutely and ſimply better, <hi>to truſt in the Lord]</hi> to truſt ſtedfaſtly in him alone, <hi>then to put any confidence]</hi> any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of truſt or confidence, <hi>in man]</hi> of what eſtate or dignity ſoeuer he be, though he be of the rancke of <hi>Princes,</hi> who haue all the power and authoritie in the world. Its euery way <hi>better to truſt in the Lord,</hi> then to truſt in ſuch, euer good to <hi>truſt in the Lord,</hi> but neuer good to truſt <hi>in man.</hi> Truſt we <hi>in the Lord,</hi> and bleſſed ſhall we be: but curſed is the man that <hi>truſteth in man,</hi> and <hi>maketh fleſh his arme;</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath ſaid it, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 17.5.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore, O <hi>Lord,</hi> ſince thou haſt from hence taught vs, that from the ayd of man there is no ſafetie to be expected, neither from him, that is <hi>of an expedite,</hi> and <hi>agile bodie,</hi> nor from <hi>the ſtrong man,</hi> nor from <hi>the mightie man,</hi> nor from <hi>the bow-man,</hi> nor from <hi>the ſwift of foote,</hi> nor from <hi>the horſeman,</hi> nor from the <hi>couragious among the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> nor from any thing elſe that is <hi>in</hi> man, or <hi>about</hi> him, giue vs grace we beſeech thee, that in thee alone wee may place all our hope and confidence. In thee alone our God and Father of mercies doe we truſt: and doe thou accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the multitude of thy compaſſions looke vpon vs. Heare the ſupplications of vs thy poore ſeruants, liuing far, as baniſhed men in a ſauage Countrey. Protect, wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, and keepe our ſoules among the many dangers of this mortall life, and bring vs by the conduct of thy gracious fauour into that thy ſacred habitation, and ſeate of eternall glory. Grant this vnto vs, moſt deare Father, for thy beſt beloued Sonne Ieſus Chriſt his ſake.</p>

                  <p>This third Chapter is <hi>Amos</hi> his ſecond Sermon againſt the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1736:335"/> Kingdome of the <hi>ten Tribes,</hi> the Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> It was made, as it ſeemeth, when their then King, <hi>Ieroboam</hi> ſonne of <hi>Ioaſh,</hi> the thirteenth King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though wicked for his life, yet happy in warre, had vanquiſhed and ſubdued many of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and had recouered the coaſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the<note n="a" place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 14.25.</note> entring of <hi>Hamath,</hi> vnto the Sea of the plaine; and had taken<note n="b" place="margin">

                     <hi>Damaſcus</hi> and <hi>Hamath.</hi> Then the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> growne inſolent with victories, and rich with ſpoiles, became laſciuient and wanton, and ſpurned at the preaching of the Word of God. It was now high time for <hi>Amos</hi> to beſtirre himſelfe, and to remember them of the fickle eſtate wherein now they were. Hee was their Prophet, peculiarly ſent to them from God; and it lay vpon him, to call vpon them. He doth it in this his ſecond Sermon.</p>
                  <p>The parts are three:
<list>
                        <item>1 An <hi>Exordium,</hi> or an entrance into the Sermon, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1.</item>
                        <item>2 A <hi>Propoſition,</hi> containing the ſumme of that whereof he admoniſheth them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2.</item>
                        <item>3 An <hi>Enarration,</hi> a <hi>Declaration,</hi> an <hi>Expoſition,</hi> or an <hi>Expolition</hi> of the matter in hand, from the third <hi>verſ.</hi> to the end of the Chapter.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are to beginne with the <hi>Exordium</hi> or <hi>entrance</hi> to the Sermon. It is an <hi>inuitation</hi> to attention: and containeth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine arguments of perſwaſion. Three they are; all of weight, and in themſelues auaileable.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is taken from the <hi>authority</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> to the hearing whereof they are inuited. It is <hi>Verbum Iehouae,</hi> the Word of <hi>Iohouah,</hi> the onely true and euerliuing God. Heare this Word, <hi>non meum ſomnium,</hi> not any dreame of mine, not my word, nor the word of any mortall wight, but the Word of the Lord, <hi>Heare this Word, that the Lord hath ſpoken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is taken from the quality of the parties inuited. They are <hi>Flij Iſrael,</hi> the children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> By this compella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are put in minde of their ſtocke and linage that they were ſprung from, and came out of the loines of <hi>Iacob,</hi> whoſe name was changed to<note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 35.10.</note> 
                     <hi>Iſrael;</hi> whereby they may well be admoniſhed, either to inſiſt in the ſteps of that holy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1736:335"/> or like diſobedient and degenerate children to expect puniſhment from the Lord: <hi>Heare this Word that the Lord hath ſpoken againſt you, O children of Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third is taken from the memory of their greateſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance, their deliuerance out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> By this benefit, had there beene nothing elſe, were the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> deepely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to giue eare to the Word of the <hi>Lord</hi> their Redeemer and deliuerer. <hi>Heare this Word, that the Lord hath ſpoken againſt you, O children of Iſrael, againſt the whole family which I brought vp from the land of Aegypt, ſaying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the handling of theſe words, I purpoſe to hold this courſe: firſt, to expound the words; and then to obſerue out of them ſuch inſtructions as they naturally offer vnto vs, and may be for our good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Heare this Word that the Lord ſpeaketh againſt you.</hi>

                     <hi>Bleſſed is the wombe that bare thee, and the paps which thou haſt ſucked,</hi> Chriſt replyed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Yea, rather bleſſed are they that heare the Word of God, and keepe it.</hi> By this his reply, he ſheweth that his Diſciples were <hi>more bleſſed</hi> for <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him,</hi> than his Mother for <hi>bearing him.</hi> Yet hereby hee denieth not his Mother to haue beene <hi>bleſſed</hi> euen for <hi>bearing him:</hi> but inſinuates onely that ſhe was <hi>more bleſſed</hi> in being his childe, than in being his Mother. Saint <hi>Auſtine, De Sancta Virginitate, cap.</hi> 3. well expreſſeth it; <hi>Beatior percipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ende fidem Chriſti, quàm concipiendo carnem Chriſti;</hi> The bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin, the Mother of Chriſt, was more bleſſed by <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing</hi> the faith of Chriſt, then by <hi>conceiuing</hi> the fleſh of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſaid vnto his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.16. <hi>Bleſſed are your eares for you heare;</hi> ſhewing, that they were <hi>more bleſſed</hi> than all the world beſides, becauſe they had this one <hi>bleſſing</hi> to heare the truth. This is the <hi>bleſſing</hi> which you come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for. God in the abundance of his goodneſſe brings it home vnto you. And well may you call it a <hi>bleſſing.</hi> For the word which we bring vnto you is <hi>verbum regni, Mat.</hi> 13.19. The word of <hi>a Kingdome;</hi> it brings <hi>a Kingdome</hi> with it: It is <hi>verbum vitae, Ioh.</hi> 6.68. the word <hi>of life:</hi> it brings <hi>life</hi> with it. It is not onely a word of <hi>authority,</hi> to command and bind the conſcience, nor onely a word of <hi>wiſdome</hi> to direct you, nor onely a word of <hi>power</hi> to conuert you, nor onely a word of <hi>grace</hi> to comfort and vphold you, but the word of a neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fading Kingdome, and of <hi>eternall life</hi> to make you perfectly and for euer bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre hath my firſt Doctrine carried mee. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was deliuered in theſe words:
<q>The word of the Lord is diligently to be hearkened vnto.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was grounded vpon the firſt branch of my Text, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is contained the firſt perſwaſory argument of attention drawne from the <hi>authority</hi> of the <hi>word</hi> to be <hi>hearkned</hi> vnto. <hi>Heare this word that the Lord ſpeaketh againſt you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next argument of perſwaſion to enforce attention in the <hi>hearer,</hi> is drawne from the perſons of them who are here inuited to giue eare. They are <hi>Filty Iſrael,</hi> the children, the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1736:342"/> ſonnes, the poſterity of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> a people deſcended from the holy Patriarke <hi>Iacob,</hi> choſen aboue all other nations to bee Gods <hi>peculiar people,</hi> with whom God had made a <hi>couenant,</hi> and had on his part moſt abſolutely performed it, preſeruing them from their enemies, and multiplying vpon them all his benefits. So graciouſly did God deale with theſe ſonnes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not onely whilſt they <hi>loued</hi> him, kept their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iugall faith with him, and ſerued him according to his word, but euen then too, when they had <hi>deſpiſed</hi> him, and forſaken him, had violated their faith with him, and committed ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall whoredome with falſe gods. Yet, when thoſe their impieties, diſobediences, and rebellions were growne to the height, <hi>God</hi> was reſolued to come againſt them in <hi>iudgement,</hi> and to <hi>puniſh</hi> them. This his reſolution appeareth in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny menaces and threats, which from time to time the <hi>Lord</hi> ſent vnto them by his holy Prophets. One of which is in my Text, <hi>Heare this word that the Lord ſpeaketh againſt you, O children of Iſrael;</hi> Againſt you, to puniſh you, <hi>O children of Iſrael,</hi> euen you. My obſeruation here is:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God will not ſpare to ſmite his deareſt children, when they ſinne againſt him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One reaſon hereof may bee, that the <hi>Lord</hi> may declare himſelfe an aduerſary to <hi>ſinne</hi> in <hi>all</hi> men without partiality.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond is, that the <hi>Lord</hi> may reduce his children from running on headlong to <hi>perdition</hi> with the wicked.</p>
                  <p>And the vſes may be two: One to teach vs, to magnifie the righteouſneſſe of God, as generally in all his workes, ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the <hi>afflictions</hi> of his people.</p>
                  <p>The other to admoniſh vs, that we looke not for any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>earthly peace,</hi> though we are by <hi>faith</hi> the children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> but that we prepare our ſelues for a continuall ſucceſſion of <hi>croſſes</hi> and <hi>calamities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third argument of perſwaſion to moue attention in theſe children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is taken from the commemoration of their greateſt deliuerance, <hi>their deliuerance out of Aegypt; Heare this w rd that the Lord ſpeaketh againſt you, O children of Iſrael; againſt the whole family, which I brought vp from the land of Aegypt.</hi> My obſeruation is:
<q>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:1736:342"/>The temporall benefits and manifold deliuerances, which the Lord beſtoweth vpon his people, are euer to be had in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and in thankefull acknowledgement.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This very doctrine for the ſubſtance of it, I haue heretofore in your hearing propounded and proued, in my <hi>fifteenth Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi> vpon the <hi>ſecond chapter</hi> of this booke, occaſioned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the <hi>tenth verſe,</hi> wherein this <hi>great deliuerance</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> is mentioned. I will not therefore at this time ſtand to inlarge it. Onely let me now tell you, that this deliuery of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> is not appropriate onely vnto them, but that in ſome ſort it appertaineth to the Church of God <hi>in all ages:</hi> for as much as it was a type of a more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing deliuery from that fearefull Kingdome of <hi>ſinne</hi> and <hi>darkneſſe.</hi> It appertaineth euen <hi>vnto vs,</hi> whom God of his infinite goodneſſe and mercy, through the precious bloud of his Sonne, and our Sauiour, <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> hath deliuered from this ſpirituall <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the Kingdome of <hi>ſinne</hi> and <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> and will in his good time giue vs ſafe paſſage from hence, to that heauenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> the true Country and Inheritance of all Saints. Whither, moſt gracious God, vouchſafe to bring vs all. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>The parts are two:

                        </item>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Commemoration</hi> is of benefits, the <hi>Commination</hi> is of puniſhments. The <hi>Commemoration</hi> is for words ſhort, yet for matter very copious. It hath reference to the many ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1736:343"/> and exceeding great benefits, which the <hi>Lord</hi> hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon his people, <hi>Iſrael. You onely haue I knowne of all the families of the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Commination</hi> is ſharpe, but very iuſt. It may ſerue thus farre to inſtruct the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that if the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhould at any time <hi>with</hi> his <hi>ſtrong hand</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>You onely!</hi> Onely you! How can this be ſo? Did not the knowledge of God extend it ſelfe to other Nations, as well as to the <hi>Iſraelites?</hi> It may not be denied. It extends it ſelfe, not to men only, but to whatſoeuer elſe is in the world.</p>
                  <p>You may conſider it two manner of waies: either <hi>in it ſelfe,</hi> or <hi>as it hath reference to things knowne.</hi> If it be conſidered <hi>in it ſelfe,</hi> it is moſt certaine, and is euer the ſame: as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and immutable, as is the very <hi>diuine Eſſence;</hi> from which it differeth not indeed, but onely conſideration. For that axiome of the Schooles is true, <hi>Quicquid eſt in Deo, eſt ipſa Dei Eſſentia;</hi> Whatſoeuer is in God, is Gods owne <hi>Eſſence.</hi> And therefore the <hi>knowledge</hi> of God is his diuine <hi>Eſſence,</hi> and God is his <hi>owne knowledge.</hi> Whence it followeth, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer God is and his <hi>holy Eſſence,</hi> there is his <hi>knowledge.</hi> Now God is euery where, his <hi>Eſſence</hi> is euery where: his <hi>knowledge</hi> therefore muſt be euery where. Its impoſſible that any thing ſhould be concealed from it.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the knowledge of God may be conſidered, <hi>as it hath reference to things knowne:</hi> and ſo alſo nothing can bee hid from it. For it knoweth <hi>it ſelfe,</hi> and <hi>euery thing elſe. Things</hi> vniuerſall and ſingular; <hi>things</hi> paſt, preſent, and to come; <hi>things</hi> which neither are, nor haue beene, nor euer ſhall bee; <hi>things</hi> neceſſary and contingent, naturall and voluntary, good and euill, atchieued and thought vpon, finite and infinite,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1736:344"/> 
                     <hi>all,</hi> are knowne vnto him. So ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. <hi>There is no creature that is not manifeſt in the ſight of God.</hi> No creature! Nay, <hi>vnto his eyes all things are naked and open.</hi> All things! How then is it, that here he ſaith to the <hi>Iſraelites, You onely haue I knowne of all the families of the earth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the cleering of this doubt, we are to note, that <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> attributed vnto God in holy Scripture, doth not euer betoken a <hi>bare</hi> and <hi>naked knowledge,</hi> but ſometimes his <hi>loue,</hi> his <hi>fauour,</hi> his <hi>care,</hi> his <hi>prouidence,</hi> his <hi>choice,</hi> his <hi>approbation,</hi> his <hi>allowance,</hi> his <hi>acceptance,</hi> or the like. As <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.6. The Lord <hi>knoweth the way of the righteous.</hi> Hee <hi>knoweth,</hi> that is, he <hi>loueth,</hi> he <hi>approueth,</hi> he <hi>accepteth,</hi> he is well <hi>pleaſed with,</hi> and graciouſly directeth, <hi>the way of the righteous.</hi> And ſo are we to expound that of the 37. <hi>Pſal. Verſ.</hi> 18. The Lord <hi>knoweth the daies of the vpright.</hi> He <hi>knoweth,</hi> that is, He doth not onely <hi>foreſee,</hi> but alſo he <hi>alloweth,</hi> he <hi>careth</hi> and <hi>prouideth</hi> for the life <hi>of the vpright.</hi> So I vnderſtand that branch of <hi>Dauid,</hi> prayer which he made in the caue, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.3. <hi>When my ſpirit was ouer-whelmed within me, then thou kneweſt my path.</hi> Thou <hi>kneweſt,</hi> that is, thou didſt <hi>approue</hi> and <hi>allow</hi> of the order of my life, and innocent conuerſation.</p>
                  <p>In the booke of <hi>Exodus, Chap.</hi> 33.17. the Lord ſaid vnto <hi>Moſes, Thou haſt found grace in my ſight, and I know thee by name.</hi> I <hi>know</hi> thee by name, that is, I haue reſpect vnto thee, I <hi>approue</hi> thee, I <hi>care</hi> and <hi>prouide</hi> for thee. In the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Propheſie of <hi>Nahum, verſ.</hi> 7. it is ſaid of the Lord, that he <hi>knoweth them that truſt in him.</hi> And there to <hi>know,</hi> is to <hi>loue,</hi> to <hi>defend,</hi> to <hi>approue,</hi> to <hi>regard.</hi> Them that truſt in him <hi>he knoweth,</hi> he ſuffers them not to periſh.

For its not to bee denied, but that among the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there were many, that had no part in this <hi>eternall election</hi> and <hi>choice</hi> of God. Many of them had no part in it, and therefore this <hi>election</hi> and <hi>choice</hi> is not here to be vnderſtood.</p>
                  <p>But there is another <hi>election</hi> and <hi>choice</hi> of God, an <hi>election</hi> and <hi>choice</hi> more generall; an <hi>election,</hi> a <hi>choice,</hi> whereby God preferreth ſome one Nation aboue others, graciouſly to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelfe, and to reueale his ſauing word vnto them.

                  </p>
                  <p>That the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were <hi>alone</hi> thus elected and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen of God, <hi>Moſes</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.7, 8. <hi>What nation,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is there ſo great, who hath God ſo nigh vnto them, as the Lord our God is in all things, that wee call vpon him for?</hi> And <hi>what nation is there ſo great, that hath ſtatutes and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo righteous, as all this Law is, which is ſet before vs this day?</hi> It is as if he had thus ſaid: Let vs bee compared with the reſt of the <hi>Nations</hi> of the world, and we ſhall finde that God is good and gracious vnto <hi>vs</hi> aboue them all.

                  <p>This doth the ſame <hi>Moſes</hi> more plainly deliuer, in ſundry places of the ſame booke of <hi>Deuteronomy, Chap.</hi> 7.6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.15. <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 26.18. In all which places his purpoſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1736:345"/> is to faſten it in the memories of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they were an <hi>holy people</hi> vnto the Lord their God: that the Lord their God had choſen them <hi>to be a peculiar people vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe aboue all people that were vpon the face of the earth.</hi> In the three firſt places is expreſly ſaid, that the Lord did <hi>chuſe Iſrael to be a peculiar people vnto himſelfe aboue all the Nations that are vpon the earth:</hi> in the fourth, that the Lord <hi>auouched</hi> them <hi>to be his peculiar people.</hi> He choſe them, he auouched them to be his peculiar people; and all for his promiſe ſake.</p>
                  <p>The promiſe is, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5. <hi>Ye ſhall be a peculiar</hi> or chiefe <hi>treaſure vnto me aboue all people, though all the earth be mine.</hi> A peculiar, or a chiefe treaſure! The Hebrew word is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Segullah,</hi> a peculiar, a chiefe treaſure vnto me aboue all people. The meaning of this promiſe is, that, although the whole earth be the Lords by the right of creation, yet this people, the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſhould aboue all other haue a ſpeciall intereſt in him. Or the meaning is, that the Lord would commit vnto this people, his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as a <hi>chiefe</hi> and <hi>principall treaſure,</hi> his Lawes and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, which he would not doe to any other people in the world beſides. So much is acknowledged, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. <hi>He ſheweth his word vnto Iacob, his ſtatutes and ordinances vnto Iſrael. He hath not dealt ſo with any Nation.</hi> Certainly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>Lord</hi> ſheweth how deare and how precious the <hi>people of Iſrael</hi> were in his eyes; and what prerogatiues they were to haue aboue other people.</p>
                  <p>A chiefe <hi>prerogatiue</hi> of theirs, is, that the Oracles of God were committed vnto them. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirmes it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>What aduantage then hath the Iew? or what profit is there of circumciſion? Much euery way:</hi> chiefly, <hi>becauſe that vnto them were committed the Oracles of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many other, and very excellent <hi>prerogatiues</hi> had they. They are heaped vp together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4.

                  </p>
                  <p>So many <hi>preeminences,</hi> are ſo many euidences and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, that of <hi>all the nations of the Earth,</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were <hi>knowne</hi> of God, were <hi>choſen</hi> by him, and were his poſſeſſion. They were <hi>knowne</hi> of him by the <hi>knowledge of his approbation:</hi> they were <hi>choſen</hi> by him, and were ſeparated from among all the people of the earth <hi>to be his inheritance.</hi> So <hi>Salomon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.53. and the Lord himſelfe here in my Text auoucheth: <hi>You onely haue I knowne of all the families of the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You will now confeſſe with me, that theſe words are, as in the beginning I ſaid they were, a <hi>Commemoration</hi> of Gods benefits vpon <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Euery <hi>prerogatiue</hi> of theirs was a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, a bleſſing of God vpon them. It was Gods bleſſing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, that to them were committed the <hi>Oracles of God.</hi> It was Gods bleſſing vpon them that they were <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that to them pertained the <hi>adoption,</hi> and the <hi>glory,</hi> and the <hi>Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,</hi> and the <hi>giuing of the Law,</hi> and the <hi>ſeruice of God,</hi> and the <hi>promiſes.</hi> It was Gods bleſſing vpon them, that theirs were <hi>the Fathers,</hi> and that of them, concerning the fleſh, <hi>Chriſt came.</hi>

                  <p>Theſe great benefits, theſe bleſſings of God vpon the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites, Albertus Magnus</hi> in his Enarration vpon the words of my Text, reduceth to the number of fiue.

                  <p>Vpon this firſt part of my Text; this <hi>Commemoration</hi> of Gods benefits beſtowed vpon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> I grounded my firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation. It is this:
<q>It is an excellent priuilege to bee knowne of God by the knowledge of his approbation; to be choſen of him to be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to be in his loue and fauour; to be vnder his care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The excellency of this <hi>priuilege</hi> appeareth in this, that the Lord here calls <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the remembrance of it, ſaying, <hi>You onely haue I knowne of all the families of the earth.</hi> This excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>priuilege,</hi> the true ſeruice of the liuing God thorow the free vſe of his holy <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sacraments</hi> whereſoeuer it is found among any people, is a ſure pledge that the Lord <hi>knoweth that people with the knowledge of his approbation,</hi> that he hath choſen them <hi>to be his peculiar people,</hi> that they are <hi>in his loue and fauour,</hi> and that he <hi>careth and prouideth for them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How much then (Beloued) how much are we indebted to the Maieſty and bounty of Almighty God, who hath graced vs with ſo excellent a bleſſing as is the Miniſtery of his holy <hi>Word?</hi> His holy <hi>Word!</hi> It is a <hi>Iewell,</hi> than which nothing is more precious; to which any thing compared is but droſſe; by which whatſoeuer is tried, will bee found lighter than vanity.</p>
                  <p>The true eſtimate of this <hi>Iewell</hi> may be had out of the 19. Pſalme. At the 7. <hi>verſ.</hi> it is <hi>Perfect,</hi> nothing may be added to it, without marring of it: it <hi>conuerteth the ſoule,</hi> and turneth it from euill to good. It is <hi>ſure;</hi> you may build vpon the truth of it, as well for the promiſes of mercy, as for the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of iudgement. It <hi>giueth wiſdome,</hi> the wiſdome of the ſpirit, euen <hi>vnto the ſimple,</hi> to the humble and lowly of minde. At the eighth verſe, It is <hi>right,</hi> without any iniuſtice or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. It <hi>reioyceth the heart,</hi> with true and ſound ioy. It is <hi>pure,</hi> pure in all points, and <hi>giueth light to the eyes,</hi> the eyes of the minde, that we may ſecurely trace the way to Heauen: At the ninth verſe, It is <hi>cleane,</hi> without ſpot or ſhew of euill, and <hi>endureth for euer</hi> without alteration or change. It is <hi>truth</hi> without falſhood, and is <hi>righteous all together,</hi> there is no er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in it.</p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:1736:347"/>
                  <p>Is your deſire for profit, or for pleaſure? This <hi>Iewell</hi> yeelds you both. At the tenth verſe; for profit, it is compared to <hi>Gold,</hi> for pleaſure to <hi>Honey.</hi> For profit it is <hi>more to bee deſired than gold,</hi> yea <hi>than much fine gold:</hi> for pleaſure, it is <hi>ſweeter than honey or the hony combe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreouer, at the tenth verſe. It will <hi>make you circumſpect;</hi> it will ſhew you the danger of ſinne, and will teach you how to auoid it, and may encourage you to obedience, for as much as in the keeping of it, <hi>there is great reward.</hi> Great reward; yet through Gods mercy, and not of your merit.</p>
                  <p>Now dearely beloued, is the holy Word of God a <hi>Iewell</hi> ſo precious? of ſuch an eſtimate? Then giue eare to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation of wiſdome, <hi>Prou.</hi> 23.23. <hi>Buy it, and ſell it not.

But let it (according to the exhortation, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> made to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> Chap. 3.16. Let it <hi>dwell in you plenteouſly in all wiſdome.</hi> It is, as one wittily ſpeaketh, Gods <hi>beſt friend,</hi> and the Kings <hi>beſt friend,</hi> and the Courts <hi>beſt friend,</hi> and the Cities <hi>beſt friend,</hi> and the Countries <hi>beſt friend,</hi> and euery mans <hi>beſt friend.</hi> Giue it therefore entertainment, not as to a forreiner or ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but as to your familiar, as to your <hi>beſt friend,</hi> let it <hi>dwell in you.</hi> And ſith it comes not empty, but brings with it, as well pleaſure, as profit, as you haue already heard, <hi>Let it dwell in you plenteouſly.</hi> Plenteouſly; Yet <hi>in all wiſdome.</hi> Let vs heare it <hi>in all wiſdome,</hi> reade it <hi>in all wiſdome,</hi> meditate vpon it <hi>in all wiſdome,</hi> ſpeake of it <hi>in all wiſdome,</hi> and preach it <hi>in all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> not only <hi>in wiſdome,</hi> but <hi>in all wiſdome,</hi> that the <hi>words of our mouthes,</hi> and the <hi>meditations of our hearts</hi> may euer be <hi>acceptable in the ſight</hi> of the Lord <hi>our ſtrength and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</hi>

Of all theſe it may be truly affirmed, that the <hi>Lord cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth</hi> them; the <hi>Lord doth</hi> them all.</p>
                  <p>Of ſuch <hi>euils</hi> is that alſo to be vnderſtood, which our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Amos</hi> hath in the ſixt verſe of this Chapter: <hi>Shall there be euill in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> The interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is vſed, the more to vrge the point. <hi>Shall there be euill in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> There ſhall be none.

                  </p>
                  <p>Hereof was holy <hi>Iob</hi> well aduiſed. The checke hee giues his Wife ſhewes it. She ſeeing him all ſmitten ouer with ſore biles from the ſole of his foot vnto the crowne of his head, falls a tempting him: <hi>Doeſt thou yet retaine thine integrity? Curſe God and die. Iobs</hi> reply vnto her is, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt as one of the fooliſh women ſpeaketh: What? Shall wee
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1736:350"/> receiue good at the hand of God, and ſhall we not receiue Euill?</hi> Shall we not receiue <hi>Euill?</hi> By <hi>Euill</hi> hee meaneth the <hi>Euill</hi> not of <hi>ſinne,</hi> but of <hi>puniſhment:</hi> as calamities, miſeries, croſſes, afflictions, and the like: which he calleth <hi>euill,</hi> not becauſe they are ſo indeed, but becauſe many thinke them ſo to bee. For things may be tearmed <hi>Euill</hi> in a two-fold vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Some are indeed <hi>Euill;</hi> ſuch are our <hi>ſinnes,</hi> and of them <hi>God is not the cauſe.</hi> Some are not indeed <hi>Euill,</hi> but onely in regard of vs, in regard of our <hi>ſenſe,</hi> of our <hi>feeling,</hi> of our <hi>apprehenſion,</hi> of our <hi>eſtimation.</hi> Such are the puniſhments, the calamities, the miſeries, the afflictions, whereto we are in this life ſubiect: and of theſe <hi>God is the cauſe.</hi> This is it which <hi>Iob</hi> acknowledgeth in the reproofe of his wiues folly; <hi>Shall we receiue good at the hand of God, and ſhall wee not receiue Euill?</hi> and it fitly ſerueth for the eſtabliſhment of my doctrine.</p>
                  <q>Whatſoeuer puniſhment befalleth any one in this life, its from the Lord.</q>
                  <p>The reaſon hereof is: becauſe the <hi>Lord</hi> is the principall doer of all things. He is the <hi>primary agent,</hi> the chiefeſt actor in all things, and therefore in <hi>all the puniſhments</hi> which doe befall vs in this life.</p>
                  <p>The vſes of this obſeruation are two:</p>
                  <p>One is to reproue ſome <hi>Philoſophers</hi> of old, and ſome igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people now adaies, for a vaine opinion of theirs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they attribute to <hi>accident, chance,</hi> and <hi>fortune,</hi> all thoſe their <hi>afflictions,</hi> from the leaſt to the greateſt, whereof they fee not any apparant cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The other is, to admoniſh vs, that when any <hi>affliction</hi> is vpon vs, we take it patiently as comming from the <hi>Lord;</hi> and repine not at the inſtruments, by whom we are afflicted. They <hi>without him</hi> could doe nothing againſt vs. Whatſoeuer they doe, they doe it by <hi>his</hi> permiſſion. The hand of <hi>his</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>prouidence</hi> is with them to appoint the <hi>beginning,</hi> and <hi>end,</hi> and <hi>meaſure,</hi> and <hi>continuance</hi> of all our afflictions. Wherefore in all our afflictions let our practiſe be, as holy <hi>Dauids</hi> was, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.9. euen to hold our peace, and ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>becauſe the Lord hath done it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:1736:350"/>
                  <p>From the <hi>Agent</hi> and his <hi>Action,</hi> I paſſe to the <hi>Patient: You.</hi> I will puniſh <hi>You. You,</hi> mine owne poſſeſſion; <hi>You,</hi> my peculiar treaſure; <hi>You,</hi> my choſen people aboue all the Nations of the earth, <hi>I will puniſh you.</hi> My obſeruation from hence is:
<q>The Lord doth puniſh his ſeruants in this life aboue others.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This truth I further proue out of Saint <hi>Peter, Epiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17. He there ſaith, <hi>The time is come, that iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt beginne at the houſe of God.</hi> At the houſe of <hi>God</hi> it muſt beginne. <hi>His</hi> ſeruants therefore muſt haue the firſt taſte of it: and the <hi>time is come</hi> for them to haue it. Is the time now come? Was it not before? Yes; it was euer. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> two of <hi>Aarons</hi> ſonnes, they offer <hi>ſtrange</hi> fire before the <hi>Lord:</hi> and a <hi>fire</hi> comes out from the <hi>Lord,</hi> and deuoures. This is it, that the <hi>Lord</hi> ſpake ſaying, <hi>In propin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis meis ſanctificabor, Leuit.</hi> 10.3. I will be ſanctified in <hi>them, that come nigh me.</hi> If they that <hi>come nigh vnto me</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe my lawes I will not ſpare <hi>them; they,</hi> euen <hi>they</hi> ſhall feele the heauineſſe of my hand.</p>
                  <p>So ſaith the <hi>Lord, Ierem.</hi> 25.29. <hi>Loe, I beginne to bring</hi> euill <hi>on the City, in which my name is called vpon.</hi> And there you ſee: It is not the ſeruice of God, not the calling vpon his holy Name, that can exempt a place from <hi>puniſhment</hi> if it be polluted with iniquity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beginne at my Sanctuary.</hi> It is the Lords direction for the puniſhment of <hi>Ieruſalem, Ezech.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Goe thorow the City, and ſmite, Let not your eye ſpare, neither haue yee pity: Slay vtterly old and young:</hi> yea, <hi>maids and little children, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> But <hi>come not neere any man vpon whom is the marke; the reſt ſlay vtterly old and young,</hi> Spare not, Pity not, and <hi>beginne at my Sanctuary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now lay we all this together: Beginne with them, <hi>that are nigh vnto me:</hi> beginne <hi>at my City,</hi> at my houſe, at my Sanctuary, ſpare none; pity none, ſmite all. You ſee my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation made good:
<q>The Lord doth puniſh his ſeruants in this life aboue others.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay in this life.</p>
                  <p>One reaſon hereof may bee; becauſe the <hi>Lord,</hi> out of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1736:351"/> his loue to his ſeruants, will not ſuffer them to goe on in ſinne.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond may be; eternall puniſhments are prepared for the wicked hereafter, and therefore here in this life are they the leſſe puniſhed.</p>
                  <p>And the vſes may be two:</p>
                  <p>One, to leſſen vs, that in the multitude and the greatneſſe of our afflictions, we acknowledge Gods great mercy, and endeuour to beare them all with patience and contentment. Whenſoeuer Gods hand ſhall be vpon vs, in iudgement for our ſinnes; let that of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. be our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <hi>When we are iudged, we are chaſtened of the Lord, that we ſhould not be condemned with the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſecond vſe may be, to ſhew vnto vs, how fearefull their caſe is, who paſſe all their time here in this world without any touch of affliction. <hi>Affliction!</hi> it is the badge of euery ſonne of God. Whoſoeuer hath no part herein, he is a <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard,</hi> he is no ſonne. So ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.8.</p>
                  <p>I haue done with the <hi>Patient;</hi> with the parties puniſhed. Now a word or two of the cauſe of their puniſhment, which is the laſt circumſtance, in theſe words; <hi>For all your iniquites.</hi> I will puniſh you <hi>for all your iniquities;</hi> for all your ſins; <hi>for all,</hi> not onely <hi>originall,</hi> but alſo <hi>actuall:</hi> and for <hi>all actuall,</hi> not onely of <hi>commiſſion,</hi> but alſo of <hi>omiſſion;</hi> not onely of <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> but alſo of <hi>ignorance;</hi> not onely of <hi>preſumption,</hi> but alſo of <hi>infirmity:</hi> I will puniſh you <hi>for all your ſinnes.</hi> For <hi>all.</hi> The obſeruation is:
<q>The Lord will not ſuffer any ſinne to eſcape vnpuniſhed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sinne!</hi> It is <hi>cauſa</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it is the <hi>impulſiue cauſe</hi> of puniſhment. It plucks downe vengeance from the Maieſtie of Heauen. Its true of euery ſinne, euen of the leaſt ſinne: <hi>Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum, immo innatum omni ſceleri, ſcelaris ſupplicium.</hi> The wages of ſinne is <hi>death.</hi> As the worke is ready, ſo the pay is preſent. <hi>Nec aufertur, nec differtur.</hi> If <hi>impiety,</hi> no <hi>impunity.</hi> Its impoſſible, any ſinne ſhould be without puniſhment. <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibl.</hi> The reaſons are two:</p>
                  <p>One is taken from the iuſtice of God. It is a part of <hi>Gods
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1736:351"/> iuſtice</hi> to puniſh ſinne, and therefore he cannot but puniſh it.</p>
                  <p>The other is taken from the truth of God. God <hi>who is euer true,</hi> hath threatned to puniſh ſinne, and therefore he will not leaue any ſinne vnpuniſhed.</p>
                  <p>The conſideration of this point, Beloued, ſhould be vnto vs a barre to keepe vs in, that we be not too ſecure, too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous of our owne eſtate. We cannot bee ignorant, for we haue learned it out of Gods Word, that wee haue whole armies of enemies to encounter withall, not only out of vs, in the world abroad, but alſo within vs lurking within our owne fleſh, euen our <hi>ſinnes.</hi> Theſe <hi>ſinnes of ours</hi> are our cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eleſt enemies. They are euer hurring vs on to puniſhment. Wherefore let vs be at vtter defiance with them; and vſe wee all holy meanes to get the victory ouer them, by the daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>repentance,</hi> and by a continuall practiſe of new obedience to Gods moſt holy Will, according to that meaſure of grace which wee haue receiued. So ſhall our ſinnes, <hi>all our ſinnes,</hi> lye drowned in the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bloud of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, as in a bottomleſſe Sea, from which they ſhall neuer be able to riſe vp againſt vs for our hurt.</p>

The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the <hi>Propoſition</hi> was; <hi>God hauing beene good and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1736:352"/> to a people,</hi> if he be repaid with vnthankfulneſſe, <hi>will aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly viſit that people, and puniſh them for all their iniquities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the poliſhing and adorning hereof we haue here diuers ſimilitudes, by diuers Interpreters, diuerſly expounded. I finde among them fiue different expoſitions.</p>
                  <p>Some will haue all theſe ſimilitudes, all ſix, to be brought to proue one and the ſame thing; namely: That <hi>no euill can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall any citie, except the Lord command it.</hi> Of this expoſition Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> makes mention. It is the expoſition of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret,</hi> and <hi>Remigius:</hi> and may runne thus. As it cannot be, <hi>that two ſhould walke together, except they be agreed;</hi> or that a Lion <hi>ſhould roare in the forreſt, when he hath no prey;</hi> or, that a Lions whelpe <hi>ſhould cry out of his den, if he haue gotten no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi> or, that a bird ſhould fall in a ſnare vpon the earth, <hi>where no gin is for him;</hi> or, that a Fowler ſhould take vp his ſnare from the ground, <hi>before he haue taken ſomewhat;</hi> or, that the Trumpet ſhould ſound an Alarum in the City, <hi>and the people not feare:</hi> ſo it cannot be, that there ſhould be any euill, <hi>any euill of puniſhment,</hi> any plague in a Citie, except the Lord command it ſo to be.</p>
                  <p>Some there are that expound theſe ſimilitudes, of Gods agreement with his Prophets for the denouncing of ſome <hi>euill</hi> that is eminent and neare at hand. <hi>Lyra, Hugo,</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> doe ſo expound them. Their expoſition runnes thus: As it cannot be, <hi>that two ſhould walke together</hi> for the diſpatch of a buſineſſe, <hi>except they be firſt agreed;</hi> or, that a Lion ſhould roare in the forreſt <hi>when he hath no prey,</hi> and ſo forth of the reſt; So it cannot be, <hi>that Gods Prophets ſhould forewarne vs of any iudgement that ſhall befall vs,</hi> except they be firſt <hi>agreed with God,</hi> and God ſpeake in them. This expoſition <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus à Caſtro</hi> takes for good, becauſe it is ſaid verſ. 7. of this Chapter, <hi>Surely, the Lord God will doe nothing, but he reuealeth his ſecret vnto his ſeruants the Prophets.</hi> By his ſeruants, the Prophets, the <hi>Lord</hi> roareth as a <hi>Lion,</hi> he layeth his <hi>ſnares</hi> as a <hi>Fowler,</hi> he ſoundeth an <hi>alarum</hi> as with a <hi>trumpet,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth <hi>euill</hi> to a <hi>Citie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others there are, that referre theſe ſimilitudes to the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1736:353"/> that is betweene God and <hi>Iſrael. Albertus, Ruper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and <hi>Iſidore,</hi> doe ſo referre them. Their expoſition may runne thus: as it cannot be, <hi>that two ſhould walke together, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be agreed;</hi> ſo it cannot be, <hi>that God ſhould walke with Iſrael.</hi> The time indeed was, when <hi>God</hi> walked with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> with <hi>God.</hi> It was then, when they of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> were deſirous to pleaſe <hi>God,</hi> to doe his holy will, and to depend vpon him. But afterward, when they forſooke <hi>God,</hi> and betooke themſelues to the ſeruice of <hi>ſtrange gods,</hi> Idoll-gods, Deuils, it could not be, that <hi>God</hi> ſhould <hi>walke</hi> any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>with them,</hi> or <hi>they</hi> with <hi>God.</hi> No maruell then, if vpon this diſagreement, the <hi>Lord</hi> by his Prophets doe <hi>roare</hi> at <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> as a <hi>Lion</hi> roareth at his prey: nor maruell, if he lay a <hi>ſnare</hi> for them, as a <hi>Fowler</hi> doth for birds: no maruell, if he ſound an <hi>alarum</hi> as with a <hi>Trumpet,</hi> and proclaime againſt them.</p>
                  <p>There is yet a fourth expoſition; the expoſition of <hi>Arias Montanus.</hi> He vnderſtands theſe ſimilitudes of the diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that was betweene the two peoples, of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iudah.</hi> Notorious was the reuolt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>Iudah:</hi> notorious the rent of the <hi>ten Tribes</hi> from the other <hi>two.</hi> By this reuolt, or rent, of <hi>one</hi> kingdome were made <hi>two:</hi> the kingdome of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and the kingdome of <hi>Iudah.</hi> Here was much a doe, much contention, which kingdome ſhould be the chiefe, which ſhould haue the preeminence. Notwithſtanding this their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, yet was there a <hi>concord</hi> betweene them: a <hi>concord,</hi> to forſake the Law of the Lord and his holy worſhip: a <hi>concord</hi> to tread the pathes of ſuperſtition, and to embrace the ſeruice of Idols. Herein they were agreed. Agreed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but <hi>not with God.</hi> The more they were agreed among themſelues, the further off they were from any agreement with God. Now this expoſition is: As it cannot be, <hi>that two ſhould walke together, except they be agreed:</hi> ſo it cannot be that <hi>God</hi> ſhould <hi>walke</hi> either with <hi>Iſrael</hi> or <hi>Iudah:</hi> As well <hi>Iudah,</hi> as <hi>Iſrael,</hi> being at oddes with <hi>God,</hi> as hauing left his holy Law, and polluted themſelues with ſuperſtition, muſt taſte of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerity of Gods diſpleaſure. <hi>God</hi> will be vnto them as a <hi>Lion</hi> that <hi>roareth</hi> at his prey; and as a <hi>ſnare</hi> that is ſpred by the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1736:353"/> 
                     <hi>Fowler;</hi> he will cauſe an <hi>alarum</hi> to be heard among them, and will ſummon them to battell, whereby their ruine ſhall be wrought: ruine vpon <hi>Iſrael</hi> through <hi>Salmanaſſer,</hi> and ruine vpon <hi>Iudah</hi> through <hi>Nabuchodonoſor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot paſſe by a fifth expoſition. I haue it from Saint <hi>Hieroms</hi> relation; from his reading <hi>Legi in cuiuſdam commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tario, rem difficilem perſuadere cupientis,</hi> I haue read, ſaith he, in a <hi>Commentary</hi> of one, that is willing to perſwade a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; that here are <hi>eight</hi> comminations, anſwering to <hi>eight</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent impieties. Thoſe <hi>eight</hi> impieties are theſe: the <hi>firſt</hi> of <hi>Damaſcus;</hi> the <hi>ſecond</hi> of <hi>Gaza,</hi> and other Cities of <hi>Palaeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> the <hi>third</hi> of <hi>Tyre;</hi> the <hi>fourth</hi> of <hi>Idumaea</hi> or <hi>Edom;</hi> the <hi>fift</hi> of the children of <hi>Ammon;</hi> the <hi>ſixt</hi> of <hi>Moab;</hi> the <hi>ſeuenth</hi> of <hi>Iudah,</hi> or of the <hi>two Tribes;</hi> the <hi>eight</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or, of the <hi>ten Tribes. Fiue</hi> of them are diſcouered in the <hi>firſt Chapter,</hi> the other <hi>three</hi> in the <hi>ſecond.</hi> To theſe <hi>eight</hi> impieties, eight com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations are here rendred; to the <hi>firſt,</hi> the <hi>firſt;</hi> to the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> the <hi>ſecond;</hi> to the <hi>reſt,</hi> the <hi>reſt</hi> in their order. <hi>Quod vtrum rerum ſit, nouerit ipſe, qui ſcripſit:</hi> But whether this be ſo, or not, let him that wrote it, looke to it. So doth Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> put by this <hi>fifth</hi> expoſition: neither doe I ſee any reaſon to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>foure</hi> former are more pertinent to this place, and of them the <hi>two firſt</hi> are moſt of all, as <hi>Caſtrus</hi> ſuppoſeth. But which is indeed the moſt pertinent, it will appeare by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular conſideration of each ſimilitude in its order. I begin with the <hi>firſt.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> ſimilitude is taken from way-faring men, from trauellers: verſ. 3.</p>
                  <p>

Will</hi> two, <hi>Would</hi> two, <hi>May</hi> twaine, <hi>Can</hi> two walke or goe together, vnleſſe <hi>they know</hi> one the other, vnleſſe <hi>they be agreed,</hi> vnleſſe <hi>they could agree,</hi> vnleſſe <hi>they meet together,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>they be agreed</hi> among themſelues? Some difference you ſee there is in the tranſlations, but the vnderſtanding of the place is not thereby much varied. I follow our neweſt and beſt approued Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Can two walke together, except they be agreed?] Can they?</hi> The anſwer muſt be negatiue; No. <hi>They cannot.</hi> Can they not? How ſo? <hi>Carthuſian</hi> ſayes they may. For a man may be compelled to walke with another. And its plaine by that, which our <hi>Sauiour</hi> in his Sermon, in the <hi>Mount,</hi> ſayes to his Auditors, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.41. <hi>Whoſoeuer ſhall compell thee to goe a mile, goe with him twaine.</hi> Now where <hi>compulſion</hi> is, there is no <hi>agreement:</hi> and therefore may two walke together, though they be <hi>not agreed.</hi> May they ſo? To what end then ſerues this Interrogation; <hi>Can two walke together, except they be agreed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer with <hi>Carthuſian,</hi> that our Prophet here ſpeaketh, <hi>ſecundum communem curſum,</hi> according to the common courſe: and <hi>communiter verum eſſe,</hi> that it is commonly true, that <hi>two</hi> cannot <hi>walke together, except they be agreed.</hi> Commonly it is true, yet not euer ſo. <hi>Druſius</hi> hath a <hi>Solent,</hi> to expreſſe the meaning with: <hi>Can two walke together, except they be agreed? Minime ſolent,</hi> they vſe not ſo to doe. <hi>Mercerus</hi> hath likewiſe his <hi>Solet, Can two walke together, except they be agreed? Ferè fieri non ſolet:</hi> it is not vſuall they ſhould doe ſo: For the moſt part they doe it not. This is it, that <hi>Paulus de Palatio</hi> hath: <hi>Solent, qui volunt iter ſimul facere, priùs ſecum de eo itinere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenire;</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:1736:354"/> they who vndertake any iourney together, doe vſe <hi>firſt</hi> to <hi>agree</hi> vpon it. Should they not <hi>firſt agree,</hi> how could they come together, how walke together? Commonly and for the moſt part they could not.</p>
                  <p>You ſee now what anſwer is to be made to the interrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here; <hi>Can two walke together, except they be agreed?</hi> The anſwer is, They <hi>cannot, Commonly</hi> they cannot, for the moſt part they cannot; vſually they cannot.

The Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> well renders it, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.37. <hi>With God nothing ſhall be vnpoſſible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>ſeuenth Chapter</hi> of Saint <hi>Matthew, verſ.</hi> 9, 10. you haue a two-fold Interrogation: <hi>What man is there of you, whom if his ſonne aske bread, will he giue him a ſtone?</hi> or <hi>if he aske a fiſh, will he giue him a ſerpent?</hi> The anſwer muſt be, <hi>No.</hi> You will not giue any ſonne of yours, a <hi>ſtone</hi> in ſtead of <hi>bread,</hi> or a <hi>ſerpent</hi> in ſtead of <hi>fiſh.</hi> You will not. You know how to giue good gifts vnto your children.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame Chapter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. the Interrogation is, <hi>Doe men gather grapes of thornes, or figges of thiſtles?</hi> The anſwer muſt be, <hi>No.</hi> They doe not. It is againſt the courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that either <hi>thornes</hi> ſhould bring forth <hi>grapes,</hi> or <hi>thiſtles figges.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such is the <hi>Interrogation</hi> here. It hath the force of a <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Can two walke together, except they be agreed?</hi> The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer muſt be, <hi>No.</hi> They cannot. Two cannot walke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>except they be agreed.</hi>

                     </gap>, the <hi>reddition</hi> of it. Hitherto hath beene <hi>rei extrariae conſideratio,</hi> now followeth <hi>rei praeſentis accommodatio:</hi> hitherto the <hi>explication</hi> of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part; now, the <hi>application</hi> of the latter. Thus:</p>
                  <p>As it cannot be, that <hi>two</hi> ſhould <hi>walke together, except they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1736:355"/> be agreed:</hi> ſo it cannot be, that the Prophets of the Lord ſhould forewarne vs of any iudgement, that ſhall befall vs, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be</hi> firſt <hi>agreed</hi> with God, and God ſpeake in them. This is the ſecond of thoſe fiue expoſitions, wherof you heard in the beginning of this exerciſe. It was the expoſition of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, Hugo,</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius:</hi> and is embraced by later Expoſitors; by <hi>Paulus de Palatio, Marthurinus Quadratus,</hi> and <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus à Caſtro,</hi> by <hi>Brentius,</hi> and <hi>Winckleman,</hi> by <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Mercer.</hi> The obſeruation is:
<q>The Prophets of the Lord cannot forewarne vs of any iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſhall befall vs, except they be firſt agreed with God, and God ſpeake in them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This truth Saint <hi>Peter</hi> expreſly deliuereth, Ep. 2. Chap. 1. verſ. 20, 21. <hi>No prophecie of the Scripture is of any priuate interpretation:</hi> for <hi>the prophecie came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men of God ſpake, as they were moued by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> The Prophets of the Lord ſpake not of their owne heads; <hi>God ſpake in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prophets!</hi> They are <hi>criers:</hi> and <hi>criers</hi> ſpeake nothing, but what is put into their mouthes. <hi>Eſay</hi> is a <hi>cryer.</hi> He makes a noiſe after the manner of a <hi>cryer, Eſay</hi> 55.1. <hi>Hoe, euery one that thirſteth, come yee to the waters.</hi> The Lord bids him <hi>cry, Eſay</hi> 40.6. and he ſaith, <hi>What ſhall I cry?</hi> Then are the words put into his mouth: <hi>All fleſh is graſſe, and all the goodlineſſe thereof is as the flower of the field. Iohn Baptiſt</hi> is a <hi>cryer.</hi> So he ſtiles himſelfe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.23. <hi>I am the voice of a cryer in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe.</hi> And how <hi>crieth</hi> he?

                  <p>
                     <hi>Prophets!</hi> They are <hi>Trumpetors.</hi> Their voice is like a <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet. Eſay</hi> 58.1. <hi>Crie aloud, ſpare not, Lift vp thy voice like a</hi> trumpet, <hi>ſhew my people their tranſgreſſion, and the houſe of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob their ſinnes.</hi> They muſt <hi>ſet the trumpet to their mouthes, Hoſ.</hi> 8.1. They muſt <hi>blow the trumpet, Ioel</hi> 2.1. But they muſt blow it with the breath of the <hi>Lord:</hi> Otherwiſe it giueth but an vncertaine ſound, and a falſe alarum.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prophets!</hi> They are <hi>Watch-men.</hi> Their office is, to heare
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1736:355"/> the Word at the Lords mouth, and then to warne the people. The charge is giuen them, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Sonne of man, I haue made thee a watch-man vnto the houſe of Iſrael: therefore heare the Word at my mouth, and giue them warning from me.</hi> This their charge is reiterated, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33.7. <hi>O ſonne of man, I haue ſet thee a watch-man vnto the houſe of Iſrael: therefore thou ſhalt heare the Word at my mouth, and warne them from me.</hi> You ſee; they are not to ſpeake a word, but they haue it from the <hi>Lord,</hi> and accordingly muſt they warne the people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ieremie,</hi> a Prophet. He <hi>eats</hi> the words of the <hi>Lord,</hi> Chap. 15.16. and is thereby fitted to his function.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> a Prophet.

Within</hi> is written, <hi>Lamentations,</hi> and <hi>mournings,</hi> and <hi>woe.</hi> This <hi>roule</hi> he is commanded <hi>to eat.</hi> He <hi>eats it.</hi> So he goes and ſpeakes vnto the houſe of <hi>Iſrael, Ezech.</hi> 3.3.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Diuine a <hi>Prophet</hi> too. He ſees an <hi>Angell</hi> with a <hi>little booke</hi> in his hand, and begs the <hi>booke.</hi> The Angell giues it him, and bids him <hi>eat it.</hi> He takes it and <hi>eats it.</hi> Then is he fit to <hi>propheſie before many peoples,</hi> and <hi>nations,</hi> and <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>tongues, Reuel.</hi> 10 11.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Prophets</hi> profeſſe of themſelues, that they ſpeake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſides the pure word of God. <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> he ſaith to the <hi>children of Iſrael: Come hither and heare the Word of the Lord your God.</hi> Chap. 3.9. The words which I ſhall deliuer vnto you concerning what ſhall come to paſſe hereafter, they are not my words; they are the words of the <hi>Lord your God. Eſay</hi> calls vpon Heauen and Earth to heare, Chap. 1.2. <hi>Heare O Heauens,</hi> and <hi>giue eare, O Earth,</hi> for the <hi>Lord hath ſpoken.</hi> The words, which I now ſpeake vnto you, they are not my words, they are the words of the Lord. <hi>Amos</hi> our Prophet: he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe calleth vpon the <hi>children of Iſrael</hi> in the beginning of this Chapter. <hi>Heare this word that the Lord hath ſpoken againſt you, O children of Iſrael.</hi> Heare it. It is not my word, it is the word of the Lord; the <hi>Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What more familiar in the writings of the Prophets, than
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1736:356"/> theſe formes of ſpeech, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Saith the Lord, the burthen of the Word of the Lord; the Word of the Lord came vnto me?</hi> They all make for the authority of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of old, and their propheſies.</p>
                  <p>From hence, as alſo from that they are <hi>Eaters</hi> of the Word of God, and are <hi>Watchmen,</hi> and are <hi>Trumpeters,</hi> and are <hi>Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> its euident, their propheſies were not of their owne wils: they ſpake not of their owne heads; God ſpake in them.</p>
                  <p>Thus the truth of my Doctrine ſtands inuiolable:
<q>The Prophets of the Lord cannot forewarne vs of any iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſhall befall vs, except they be firſt agreed with God, and God ſpeake in them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here firſt is a leſſon for <hi>vs,</hi> who ſucceed the <hi>Prophets</hi> in the Miniſtery of the Church. We may not deliuer any thing vnto you, but what wee haue gathered out of the Word of God. Euery <hi>Miniſter</hi> of the New Teſtament, ſhould bee as <hi>Moſes</hi> was of the Old. <hi>Moſes</hi> his charge was not to conceale any thing, but to <hi>ſpeake all, Exod.</hi> 7.2. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſpeake all that I command thee.</hi> It is our part to doe the like. It is our part to ſpeake in the Name of God, and in his Name alone, to feed the flocke of Chriſt with his <hi>pure word,</hi> and with his <hi>word alone:</hi> and to doe it as <hi>learnedly,</hi> as <hi>faithfully,</hi> as <hi>ſincerely,</hi> as <hi>conſtantly</hi> as we may; leauing the ſucceſſe of all to him that hath ſent vs, and diſpoſeth of all mens hearts at his pleaſure. So running our race, we ſhall one day be at reſt in eternall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, fully deliuered from this vile world, from wicked men, from euill natures: from ſuch, who are euer ready to take our beſt endeuours in the worſt ſenſe, and to require our honeſt affections with their foule diſgraces.</p>
                  <p>Here ſecondly is a leſſon for <hi>you.</hi> For <hi>you,</hi> Beloued: for all ſuch as are the Auditors and hearers of the Word of God. This duty of hearing is to be put in practice; not <hi>dully,</hi> but with diligence; not <hi>heauily,</hi> but with chearefulneſſe, as to the <hi>Lord.</hi> There is a generation of <hi>hearers,</hi> that would ſeeme deſirous to <hi>heare</hi> the Word preached, but they would haue it of free coſt: they like not the charges it bringeth with it. O let not any ſuch repiner, any ſuch grudger be found in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1736:356"/> the aſſembly of the Saints. Such, if they conferre any thing to the maintenance of the Miniſtery, they doe it not for <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake,</hi> but of neceſſity; not for any <hi>loue</hi> they beare vnto the Word preached, but by compulſion of Law: not as a <hi>free will offering</hi> to God for the recompence of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome among them, but as a taxation, which they cannot reſiſt. To ſuch the preaching of the Word is not a <hi>benefit,</hi> but a burthen. So farre are they from taking any delight therein, as that by their good wills they would wholly ſhake and ſhift it off. Carnally minded men, careleſſe and prodigall of the ſaluation of their owne ſoules. The <hi>horſe-keeper</hi> that dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth their horſes, the <hi>ſhepheard</hi> that watcheth their ſheepe, the <hi>heardman</hi> that looketh to their ſwine, the <hi>Cobler</hi> that clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth their ſhooes, ſhall willingly be conſidered for their paines: but the <hi>Miniſter</hi> or <hi>Paſtor</hi> that breaketh vnto them the bread of life, ſhall haue no ſupply from them to the releefe of his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities. No ſupply! Nay, well were he if he could hold his owne, euen that portion of maintenance, which is allotted to him by the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>But I hope there cannot be found in this aſſembly, any one ſo ſacrilegiouſly affected. I haue good reaſon to be perſwaded much better of you all. Yet <hi>you,</hi> as well affected as you are in this behalfe, are to be admoniſhed, that to theſe exerciſes of our religion ye come <hi>willingly</hi> and <hi>ioyfully. Willingly</hi> for your owne duties ſake, and <hi>ioyfully,</hi> becauſe from hence you may carry home with you a Iewell of an inualuable price, euen the precious Word of God: wherein <hi>quicquid docetur, veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas; quicquid praecipitur, bonitas; quicquid promittitur, felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas eſt,</hi> as <hi>Hugo lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Anima</hi> ſpeaketh: Whatſoeuer is taught, its <hi>truth;</hi> whatſoeuer is commanded, its <hi>goodneſſe;</hi> whatſoeuer is promiſed, its <hi>happineſſe. Nam Deus veritas eſt, ſine fallaciâ; bonitas, ſine malitiâ; felicitas, ſine miſeriâ:</hi> for God is truth, without falſhood; goodneſſe, without malice; happineſſe, without miſery.</p>
                  <p>O come ye then hither, as <hi>willingly</hi> for your duties ſake, ſo alſo <hi>ioyfully</hi> for your profits ſake. <hi>Willingly,</hi> and <hi>ioyfully.</hi> It is ſomewhat, I grant, to come hither, to this houſe of God to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1736:357"/> diuine ſeruice; but to come <hi>willingly</hi> and <hi>ioyfully,</hi> it is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vertue, and that which giueth life vnto your comming. If you come <hi>vnwillingly</hi> or <hi>grudgingly,</hi> if you be drawne hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either for ſhame of the world, or through feare of Law, you come as men more than halfe dead, without either ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſpirit, or deſire of profit, or feeling of comfort, or increaſe of faith, or bettering of obedience.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, dearely Beloued, let your care be, euer <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly</hi> and <hi>ioyfully</hi> to preſent your ſelues in theſe Courts of the <hi>Lord,</hi> in his holy Temple. Be ye well aſſured, that as hee is <hi>accurſed</hi> that <hi>doth the worke of the Lord negligently;</hi> ſo is hee alſo accurſed that commeth into the houſe of the Lord either <hi>vnwillingly</hi> or <hi>grudgingly,</hi> as if he were diſcouraged with the tediouſneſſe either of the way, or of the word.</p>
                  <p>It is recorded of the people of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. that they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling towards the place of Gods worſhip, paſſed through many dangers, endured much heat, ſuffered wants in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, and all for the delight they tooke in his ſeruice. The delight that they tooke in the ſeruice of God, did ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vp all their wants, their trauell, their labour, and their paines. It made them ſay; <hi>A day in thy courts is better than a thouſand.</hi> And, <hi>I had rather be a doore-keeper in the houſe of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedneſſe. A day in thy courts is better than a thouſand.] A day]</hi> one day onely, and no more, <hi>in thy courts]</hi> in the courts of God, in his Temple, and the publike meetings and aſſemblies there, <hi>is better]</hi> is more ſweet, more comfortable, more profitable, <hi>than a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand]</hi> elſewhere, yea, though the place bee neuer ſo full of pleaſure. And, <hi>I had rather be a doore-keeper in the houſe of my God]</hi> I had rather be of the meaneſt account in the Church, the place where my God, the onely true and euerliuing God is ſerued; <hi>than to dwell in the tents of wickedneſſe]</hi> than to make my abode in moſt ſtately and gorgeous Palaces, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wickedneſſe is practiſed and profeſſed. <hi>O! how amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hoſts!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How excellent was this <hi>zeale</hi> of Gods people? how great their forwardneſſe to doe him ſeruice? We would be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1736:357"/> Gods people, as well as they. But where is our <hi>zeale?</hi> Were ours as theirs was, certainly neither blaſts of wind, nor feare of raine, nor heat of Summer, nor cold of Winter, nor a <hi>Lion</hi> in the way, nor any like trifle ſhould ſtop vs from comming to the houſe of God, his <hi>Temple,</hi> the place where by his <hi>Miniſters</hi> he ſpeaketh to his people.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre by the occaſion of my firſt obſeruation, which was grounded vpon the ſecond of thoſe fiue expoſitions, whereof you heard in the beginning of this exerciſe. My obſeruation was:
<q>The Prophets of the Lord cannot forewarne vs of any iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that ſhall befall vs, except they be firſt agreed with God, and God ſpeake in them. <hi>I proceed.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſecond application of this firſt ſimilitude to the matter here intended by the Holy Ghoſt, may be thus: As it cannot be, that <hi>two</hi> ſhould <hi>walke together, except they be agreed;</hi> So it cannot be that <hi>God</hi> ſhould <hi>walke</hi> with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for as much as there is a <hi>diſagreement</hi> betweene them. The time indeed was, when <hi>God</hi> walked with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> with <hi>God.</hi> Then it was, when the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were deſirous to pleaſe <hi>God,</hi> to doe his holy will, and to depend vpon him. But afterward, when rebelliouſly they forſooke <hi>God,</hi> and applied themſelues to the ſeruice of <hi>falſe gods,</hi> it could not be, that <hi>God</hi> ſhould any longer <hi>walke</hi> with them, or <hi>they</hi> with <hi>God.</hi> This is the third of thoſe fiue expoſitions, whereof euen now you heard. It was the expoſition of <hi>Albertus, Rupertus,</hi> and <hi>Iſidore;</hi> and is embraced by later Expoſitors, by <hi>Franciſcus Ribera,</hi> by <hi>Petrus Luſitanus,</hi> by <hi>Oecolampadius, Danaeus, Gualter, Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mellius,</hi> and <hi>Iunius,</hi> and <hi>Piſcator.</hi> The obſeruation is:
<q>When man through his euill courſes leaueth off to walke with <hi>God,</hi> or forſaketh <hi>him;</hi> then will <hi>God</hi> no longer walke with <hi>man,</hi> but will alſo forſake <hi>him.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To <hi>walke with God</hi> is louingly to adhere vnto him, and to pleaſe him. So is the phraſe vſed in the Propheſie of <hi>Micah, Chap.</hi> 6.8. <hi>What doth the Lord require of thee, O man, but to doe iuſtly, and to loue mercy, and to humble thy ſelfe to walke with thy God.</hi> To <hi>walke with thy God,</hi> that is, <hi>Ionathan</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1736:358"/> it, to walke in the worſhip and feare of God. <hi>Petrus Luſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> ſaith, it is to liue according to the Law and will of God. And this doubtleſſe is to pleaſe God.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Enoch, Gen.</hi> 5.22, 24. that he <hi>walked with God.</hi> He <hi>walked</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> that is, hee <hi>pleaſed God.</hi> So doth the <hi>Author of the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes</hi> expound the place, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.5. <hi>Enoch before his tranſlation, had this teſtimony, that hee</hi> pleaſed God. The teſtimony which he had was, that he <hi>wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with God;</hi> and therefore to <hi>walke</hi> with God, is to <hi>pleaſe</hi> God. <hi>Syracides</hi> in the 44. of his <hi>Eccleſiaſticus, verſ.</hi> 16. ſaith to the ſame effect. <hi>Enoch pleaſed the Lord, and was tranſlated, being an example of repentance to all generations. Enoch pleaſed the Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eccleſiaſticus;</hi> in <hi>Geneſis</hi> it is, <hi>Enoch walked with God:</hi> and therefore to <hi>walke</hi> with God is to <hi>pleaſe</hi> God. <hi>On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelos</hi> ſaith it is, to liue in the feare of God; ſurely he that ſo liueth pleaſeth God.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 6.9. that he <hi>walked with God: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> was a iuſt man, perfect in his generations, and <hi>walked with God.</hi> He <hi>walked with God,</hi> Whats that? He liued a ſolitary life, and profeſſed Monkery? No: He left the concourſe of the world, and got him aſide into ſome wilderneſſe? Nor ſo. He lead a ſingle life, and therefore no maruell if hee pleaſed God? Nor this. What is it then, he <hi>walked with God?</hi> It is this: He <hi>ſerued God,</hi> as was fit he ſhould, <hi>in his vocation;</hi> he liued piouſly, and without blame: hee compoſed himſelfe, not to mans becke, to mans example, to mans applauſe, but wholly to the holy Will of God: in a word, he led a life ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and pleaſing vnto God; and ſo he <hi>walked with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which God ſaith to <hi>Abram, Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Walke before me, and be thou perfect,</hi> is all one, as if he had ſaid, <hi>Walke with me,</hi> and be thou perfect. To walke <hi>with God,</hi> or to walke <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God,</hi> is all one. It is not <hi>Foris ſimulare pietatem, hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum more;</hi> it is not to make outwardly a ſhew of piety, as <hi>Hypocrites</hi> vſe to doe; but it is <hi>Syncere Deo fidere;</hi> it is to truſt in God ſincerely, to depend vpon him wholly, to ſerue him alone, and to obey him according to his will. Such are thoſe ſeruants of the Lord, of whom <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaketh, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:1736:358"/> 6.14. that <hi>walke before the Lord with all their hearts.</hi> Such are they that <hi>walke in the Law of God, Exod.</hi> 16.4. Such they, that <hi>walke after the Lord their God, Deut.</hi> 13.4. where they are further deſcribed to <hi>feare the Lord,</hi> to <hi>keepe his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,</hi> to <hi>obey his voice,</hi> to <hi>ſerue him,</hi> and to <hi>cleaue vnto him.</hi> In the language of <hi>Canaan</hi> you ſee it is all one, to walke <hi>in the Law of God,</hi> to walke <hi>before God,</hi> to walke <hi>after God,</hi> and to walke <hi>with God.</hi> The <hi>Metaphore</hi> is very elegant: and may ſerue thus farre to inſtruct vs; that, as when we <hi>walke,</hi> we ſtand not ſtill, but are euer in motion, and doe goe forward: ſo in the way of piety, in the courſe of godlineſſe, when wee <hi>walke</hi> either in <hi>the Law of God,</hi> or <hi>after God,</hi> or <hi>before God,</hi> or <hi>with God,</hi> we are not to ſtand ſtill, but are euer to bee in <hi>motion,</hi> in a ſpirituall motion, and to goe forward: to <hi>goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> as <hi>Origen</hi> ſpeaketh in his twelfth <hi>Homily</hi> vpon <hi>Geneſis, De vita ad vitam, de actu ad actum, de bonis ad meliora, de vtilibus ad vtiliora, de ſanctis ad ſanctiora.</hi> Our going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward muſt be from <hi>life</hi> to life, from <hi>action</hi> to action, from <hi>good</hi> to better, from <hi>profitable</hi> to more profitable, from <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified actions</hi> to more ſanctified: and all this muſt bee, <hi>Non paſſibus pedum, ſed mentis profectibus,</hi> not with the ſteps of our feet, but with the profit of our vnderſtanding. Our <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in this our <hi>walke</hi> muſt be perpetuall. <hi>Hominis, quâ Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianus eſt, proprium eſt, non quieſcere:</hi> it is the propriety of a man, as he is a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> not to be at quiet, not to reſt, not to ſtand ſtill, not to be at a ſtay. For <hi>in Schola Chriſti non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredi eſt regredi:</hi> in the Schoole of Chriſt, not to goe forward, is indeed to goe backward. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> in his 341. Epiſtle thus expreſſeth it; In the Schoole of Chriſt, <hi>Non proficere, ſine dubio deficere eſt:</hi> not to proceed and profit, without doubt it is to retire and to faint. And therefore let no man ſay, <hi>Satis eſt, ſic volo manere, ſufficit mihi eſſe, ſicut heri &amp; nudius tertius:</hi> It is enough for me; thus will I abide; its ſufficient for me that I am as I was yeſterday and the day before. Let no man ſay thus with himſelfe. <hi>In viâ reſidet, qui huiuſmodi eſt;</hi> he that is ſuch a one ſits him downe in the <hi>way.</hi> He goes not forward: he walkes not, as he ſhould, either <hi>in the Law of God,</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:1736:359"/> or <hi>before God,</hi> or <hi>after God,</hi> or <hi>with God.</hi> Thus farre hath this Metaphor of <hi>walking</hi> led me. Yet may I not leaue it without giuing ſome rule of it. The rule is: <hi>Solet Scriptura verbo</hi> Ambulandi <hi>conſenſionem animorum explicare:</hi> it is the cuſtome of the Scripture, by this word of <hi>walking</hi> to expreſſe the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſent of minds.</p>
                  <p>It is the voice of wiſdome to her ſonne, <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 1.15. <hi>My ſonne, if ſinners ſhall ſay vnto thee, Come with vs, caſt in thy lot among vs, let vs all haue one purſe, Walke not thou in the way with them; refraine thy foot from their path. Walke</hi> thou not in the way with them, that is, <hi>ne acquieſcas eis, ne illis aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaris,</hi> yeeld not to them, agree not with them. This expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is good by that, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>My ſonne, if ſinners intiſe thee, conſent thou not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Syracides</hi> in his <hi>Eccleſiaſticus, Chap.</hi> 7.38. according to the vulgar ſaith, <hi>Non de ſit plorantibus in conſolatione, &amp; cum lugentibus ambula.</hi> Faile not to be a comfort to them that weepe, and <hi>walke</hi> with them that mourne. <hi>Walke</hi> with them that mourne, that is, <hi>Idem ſentito, quod illi,</hi> thinke as they thinke; <hi>Eo animo eſto, ac ſi tua eſſent illa mala:</hi> be thou affected, as if their loſſes were thine.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 1.1. pronounceth the man bleſſed, that <hi>walketh not in the counſell of the wicked.</hi> There is therefore a <hi>walking</hi> in the counſell of the wicked. But what is it ſo to <hi>walke?</hi> To <hi>walke in the counſell of the wicked,</hi> is to yeeld thine aſſent, to agree vnto, to ioyne thy ſelfe in naughty practiſes with the wicked. Bleſſed is the man that ſo <hi>walketh not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Enough for the rule. The rule was: It is the cuſtome of the Scripture by this word of <hi>Walking</hi> to expreſſe the agreement and conſent of mindes. Its iuſtified by my Text: <hi>Can two</hi> walke <hi>together except they be agreed?</hi> and may conclude the truth of my obſeruation:
<q>When man through his euill courſes leaueth off to <hi>walke</hi> with God, then will God no longer <hi>walke</hi> with him. <hi>When</hi> man forſaketh God, then will God alſo forſake him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then,</hi> and not before. The ancient Fathers are frequent in auowing this truth. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his booke, <hi>De bono
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1736:359"/> Perſeuerantiae, cap.</hi> 6. giues it for granted; <hi>Voluntate ſuà quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que deſerere Deum, vt meritò deſeratur à Deo;</hi> that a man of his owne will <hi>firſt forſakes</hi> God, that God may well <hi>forſake</hi> him. The ſame Father in his 88. Sermon <hi>De Tempore,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts his then Auditors, faithfully and firmely to beleeue, that God neuer forſakes man, <hi>niſi prius deſeratur ab homine,</hi> vnleſſe he be firſt forſaken of man. In his <hi>Soliloquies, cap.</hi> 14. he brings in the ſoule in her priuate talke with God acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging as much: <hi>Quocunque iero, tu me Domine non deſeris, niſi prior ego te deſeram:</hi> O my Lord, goe I whither I will, thou wilt <hi>neuer forſake</hi> me, vnleſſe I <hi>forſake thee firſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe writeth Saint <hi>Proſper</hi> in his anſwer to the obiections of the <hi>French,</hi> his ſentence vpon the ſeuenth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection: Although the omnipotency of God could haue giuen to them that would fall, ſtrength to ſtand, <hi>Gratia tamen eius non prius eos deſeruit, quàm ab eis deſereretur;</hi> Yet did not God <hi>forſake</hi> them, before hee was <hi>forſaken</hi> of them.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> in his deuouteſt Meditations, <hi>cap.</hi> 7. ſpeakes home to this point. <hi>God! fidelis ſocius eſt,</hi> hee is a faithfull companion; <hi>nec deſerit ſperantes in ſe, niſi ipſe prior deſeratur,</hi> and <hi>forſakes</hi> not them that truſt in him, vnleſſe he be firſt <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken</hi> of them.</p>

                     <hi>Macarius,</hi> what <hi>others</hi> of the <hi>ancient</hi> haue in their bookes deliuered concerning the point in hand. Sufficient hath beene ſaid already, not onely for the confirmation, but alſo for the illuſtration of my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond obſeruation; which was,
<q>When man, through his euill courſes, leaueth off to <hi>walke</hi> with God, then will God no longer <hi>walke</hi> with him. When man <hi>forſaketh</hi> God, then will God alſo <hi>forſake</hi> him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why is it thus? Why is it, that man <hi>firſt</hi> leaues off to <hi>walke</hi> with God, ere God leaues off to <hi>walke</hi> with man? Why is it, that man firſt <hi>forſakes</hi> God, ere God <hi>forſake</hi> him?</p>
                  <p>The reaſon hereof may bee taken from the promiſe of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1736:360"/> God. His promiſe is to <hi>Ioſhua, chap.</hi> 1.5. <hi>I will not leaue thee nor forſake thee.</hi> Not to <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> alone is this promiſe made, but to all; to all the godly. The Author of the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> ſo applies it, <hi>chap.</hi> 13.5. <hi>I will neuer leaue thee nor forſake thee.</hi> He brings it for a motiue againſt Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe; againſt the vnſatiable greedineſſe after the <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> of this world, which is to many their <hi>delight,</hi> their <hi>loue,</hi> their <hi>ſolace,</hi> and to ſome their <hi>God.</hi> Let your conuerſation <hi>bee without Couetouſneſſe, and be content with ſuch things as you haue. For hee hath ſaid,</hi> God hath ſaid it, <hi>I will neuer leaue it, I will neuer leaue thee nor forſake thee.</hi> God is euer as good as his word. Hee hath ſaid it, <hi>I will neuer leaue thee nor forſake thee.</hi> Nor will he. Looke what care hee had of <hi>Ioſhuah,</hi> the like he hath of all that truſt in him. Hee <hi>will neuer leaue</hi> them, <hi>hee will not forſake</hi> them. If they leaue God, if they leaue off to <hi>walke</hi> with him, if they <hi>forſake</hi> him, ſo it is: the fault is their owne, God is no way to bee blamed.</p>
                  <p>Now lets make ſome vſe of my ſecond obſeruation: I can but point at it.</p>
                  <p>If it be thus, Beloued. If God leaues not off to <hi>walke with vs,</hi> till we leaue off to <hi>walke with him;</hi> if he <hi>forſake not vs,</hi> till wee <hi>forſake him:</hi> O then let it be our care, neuer to leaue off to <hi>walke with him,</hi> neuer to <hi>forſake him.</hi> Our ſinnes they are, that breake off our <hi>walke</hi> with God, and cauſe vs to <hi>forſake</hi> him. To what purpoſe make wee a ſhew of <hi>wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> with him, of delighting in him, if in the meane time wee hold faſt by thoſe <hi>funes peccatorum</hi> of<note n="a" place="margin">

If by our <hi>ſinnes,</hi> our <hi>drunkenneſſe,</hi> our <hi>luxury,</hi> our <hi>vncleanneſſe,</hi> our <hi>coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe,</hi> our <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> our <hi>vncharitableneſſe,</hi> and other our ſinnes no leſſe odious, which indeed are the very diet and dainties of the Deuill, we feaſt the foule fiends of Hell, wee driue God from vs. He can no longer <hi>walke with vs,</hi> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>but forſake vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:1736:360"/>
                  <p>What ſhall wee then doe, Beloued? What? Certainly, <hi>Ne Deum moueamus, vt nos deſerat, opus eſt vt inter nos &amp; ipſum conueniat:</hi> that wee cauſe not God to <hi>forſake vs,</hi> there muſt bee betweene him and vs <hi>an agreement.</hi> Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there can bee none, if wee goe on ſtill to prouoke him with our impieties. Wherefore that there may bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs <hi>an agreement,</hi> tread wee the way ſcored out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs by Saint <hi>Paul, Titus</hi> the ſecond Chapter and the twelfth Verſe, which is, that, <hi>denying vngodlineſſe and worldly luſts,</hi> we liue for the time to come <hi>ſoberly, righteouſly,</hi> and <hi>godlily</hi> in this preſent world, looking for that bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearing of the <hi>great God,</hi> and our Sauiour <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> So doing, wee ſhall bee at <hi>agreement</hi> with God and <hi>walke</hi> with him.</p>
                  <p>But here, Beloued, <hi>Magna cuſtodia tibi neceſſaria eſt,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaketh in the ſixth Chapter of his Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Its neceſſary that thou keepe a diligent watch and ward ouer thy ſelfe, that thou neither doe, nor ſay, nor thinke any thing that is vnlawfull, and may offend. For thou liueſt before the eyes of the Iudge that ſeeth all things. <hi>Cum illo tamen ſemper et ſecurus,</hi> yet with him, with ſo all-ſeeing a Iudge, thou art ſecure and ſafe, if thou ſo behaue thy ſelfe, that hee may vouchſafe <hi>to bee with thee.</hi> What ſaid I? So behaue thy ſelfe that hee may vouchſafe <hi>to bee with thee?</hi> Nay howeuer thou behaue thy ſelfe, hee will not faile to bee with thee. <hi>Si tecum non eſt per gratiam, ad-eſt per vindictam;</hi> if he be not with thee by <hi>his gracious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,</hi> he will aſſuredly be with thee <hi>in vengeance,</hi> to pay thee home for thy miſ-doings. <hi>Sed vae tibi, ſi ita tecum eſt:</hi> but woe is thee, if he be ſo with thee.</p>
                  <p>What then remaineth for thee, for mee, for euery one of vs, but that we all endeuour ſo to ſpend the reſidue of the daies of our pilgrimage here in this life, in all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and true holineſſe, that God, <hi>our good God,</hi> bee not at any time prouoked to bee with vs, <hi>per vindictam,</hi> by his vengeance, who is euer moſt willing to be with vs <hi>per
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1736:361"/> gratiam,</hi> by his gracious fauour. So hauing finiſhed our courſe here, in this mortality, wee ſhall bee aduanced to a ſtate immortall in the Paradiſe of Heauen, where wee ſhall with all Saints ſing perpetually <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> Saluation, and Honour, and Glory, and Power, vnto the Lord our God.

                  <p>This <hi>fourth verſe,</hi> now read vnto you, will yeeld vs two other, taken from the cuſtome of <hi>Lions, old</hi> and <hi>young.</hi> From the cuſtome of the <hi>old Lion</hi> in theſe words; <hi>Will a Lion roare in the foreſt, when he hath no prey?</hi> From the cuſtome of the <hi>young Lion,</hi> in theſe; <hi>Will a young Lion cry out of his den, if he haue taken nothing at all?</hi> Of both in their order: and firſt of the <hi>old Lion.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Will a Lion roare in the foreſt, when he hath no prey?]</hi> The anſwer ſhould be negatiue; No; he will not. <hi>Will he not?</hi> It ſeemes he will. Elſe how may that bee vnderſtood which is ſpoken of our aduerſary, the <hi>Deuill,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. that he, <hi>as a roaring Lion walketh about, ſeeking whom he may deuoure?</hi> There it ſeemes the <hi>Lion roareth</hi> before hee haue his prey. That he doth ſo, many of the Ancient haue affirmed it. Its affirmed by <hi>R. Dauid,</hi> he ſaith; When the beaſts of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt heare the <hi>Lions voice,</hi> they by and by through feare ſtand ſtill, and the <hi>Lion</hi> taketh for his prey, which of them hee will. So ſaith <hi>Lyra; Ad rugitum Leonis praeda ſequitur;</hi> the <hi>Lion roareth,</hi> and then he takes his prey. So <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Carthuſian; Leo cum famem patitur, mox vt beſtiam vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, rugitum dat, quo audito territa beſtia gradum figit, &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitur.</hi> The <hi>Lion,</hi> ſaith he, when he is hungry, if he ſee a beaſt, <hi>roareth:</hi> the beaſt, terrified with the <hi>Lions voice,</hi> ſtands ſtill and is taken. Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaies as much for ſubſtance. His words are in his ninth Homily vpon the <hi>Hexaemeron:</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath beſtowed vpon the <hi>Lion,</hi> ſuch organs or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for his voice, that oftentimes beaſts farre ſwifter than the <hi>Lion</hi> are taken, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, onely by <hi>the roaring of the Lion.</hi> The <hi>Lion roares;</hi> the beaſt ſtoopes, and is taken.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Cyril</hi> likewiſe, he that was <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> he hath the like obſeruation, and he takes it from thoſe, who with much curioſity and diligence haue ſought into
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1736:362"/> the nature of wild beaſts. The obſeruation is, that the <hi>hungry Lion,</hi> eſpying ſome beaſt fit for his food, through his hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and vncouth roaring ſeizeth vpon it for his prey. Now if a <hi>Lion</hi> will <hi>roare</hi> before he haue taken his prey, as by the now produced authorities it ſeemes he will, to what end ſerues this interrogation, <hi>Will a Lion roare in the forreſt, when he hath no prey?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I muſt anſwer as I did out of <hi>Carthuſian</hi> to the former ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, that <hi>Amos</hi> here ſpeaketh, <hi>ſecundum communem cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi> according to the common courſe, and <hi>communiter ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum eſſe,</hi> that its commonly true that <hi>a Lion will not roare in the forreſt, when he hath no prey.</hi> Commonly it is true, yet not euer ſo. <hi>Mercerus</hi> hath a <hi>Solet</hi> to expreſſe the meaning with: <hi>Will a Lion roare in the forreſt, when he hath no prey? Non ſolet haud dubiè;</hi> Without doubt he vſeth not ſo to doe. <hi>Druſius</hi> hath likewiſe a <hi>Solent</hi> for the ſaluing of this queſtion; <hi>Leones non ſolent rugire, niſi praedam ceperint, capturine ſint; Lions,</hi> they vſe not to <hi>roare,</hi> vnleſſe <hi>they haue taken ſome prey,</hi> or are ready to take it. They vſe it not, though it may be ſometime <hi>they doe it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why will a <hi>Lion roare</hi> when he hath <hi>gotten</hi> his prey? Should he not then rather be quiet, and fall to the deuouring of his prey? <hi>Plutarch</hi> in a treatiſe of his, concerning this queſtion, <hi>Which creatures haue more reaſon, they that liue on the earth, or they that in the water?</hi> thus ſpeaketh of the <hi>Lion:</hi> The <hi>Lion,</hi> when he hath <hi>gotten a prey</hi> vſeth to <hi>roare,</hi> thereby to call his <hi>fellow-lions</hi> to be his partakers in the prey. But I will not now diue into the ſecrets of nature. Why the <hi>Lion roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi> when he hath his prey, it much skilleth not: it is plaine, <hi>he roareth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is plaine by the 22. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> where <hi>Dauid</hi> complaining of the cruelty of his enemies vnder the name of the <hi>Bulls of Baſhan,</hi> ſaith of them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. <hi>They gaped vpon mee with their mouthes, as a rauening and a roaring Lion.</hi> It is likewiſe plaine by the 31. of <hi>Eſay.</hi> At the fourth verſe of that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you may ſee the <hi>Lion roaring on his prey.</hi> In the 22. of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel,</hi> verſe 25. you may behold in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> a conſpiracy of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1736:363"/> Prophets <hi>like a roaring Lion, rauening the prey.</hi> Well then is it demanded by <hi>Amos</hi> in my Text, <hi>Will a Lion roare in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, when he hath no prey?</hi> Thus farre of the <hi>old Lion.</hi> It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth of the <hi>young.</hi>

                  <p>Now to the queſtion, as it is made by <hi>Tauerner, Cryeth a Lions whelpe out of his den, except he haue gotten ſome thing?</hi> or as it is in our neweſt <hi>Engliſh, Will a young Lion cry, or giue forth his voice out of his den, if he haue taken nothing?</hi> My anſwer muſt be, as it was to that of the <hi>old Lion,</hi> and out of <hi>Mercer</hi> too, <hi>Non ſolet haud dubiè,</hi> Out of doubt, the <hi>young Lion,</hi> or <hi>Lions whelpe</hi> vſeth not, as he lieth in his den, to <hi>giue forth his voice,</hi> to cry or roare <hi>except hee haue gotten ſomewhat.</hi> Hee vſeth not ſo to doe.</p>
                  <p>Some Expoſitors there are, that will haue theſe two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the <hi>Lion,</hi> and the <hi>Lions whelpe</hi> to be all one; and the latter to be but a repetition of the former, <hi>mutatis verbis,</hi> in other words.

Abraham.</hi> So <hi>Albertus, Rupertus, Carthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi> and others: and with theſe accordeth our preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
                  <p>The expoſition thus giuen, deſcend we to the application,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1736:363"/> that we may vnderſtand what this <hi>Lion</hi> is, and what the <hi>Lions whelpe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Will a Lion roare in the foreſt, when he hath no prey?</q>
                  <p>The <hi>Lion</hi> is <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>foreſt</hi> the <hi>world,</hi> the <hi>prey of the Lion</hi> the people of the world, the <hi>roaring of the Lion</hi> Gods threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings by his Prophets. You may thus apply it: As <hi>a Lion will not roare in the foreſt,</hi> vnleſſe <hi>he haue a prey;</hi> So neither will <hi>God</hi> by his Prophets threaten any euill, vnleſſe he bee thereunto vrged by the ſinnes of the people. Such commonly is the application of this ſecond ſimilitude.</p>
                  <p>With <hi>Rupertus</hi> likewiſe this <hi>Lion</hi> is <hi>God;</hi> but the Lions prey is <hi>omnis electus,</hi> euery one of the Elect: who, whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he be, becauſe he is predeſtinate vnto life, <hi>ab ipſo Deo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiritur,</hi> is ſought for of God himſelfe, that at his <hi>voice,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be vttered by an <hi>Angell,</hi> or by a <hi>Prophet,</hi> or by the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> he may tremble, may be humbled, may repent him of his ſinnes, and be ſaued. The application which he maketh is after this manner: <hi>Nunquid rugiet Leo in ſaltu, niſi habuerit praedam?</hi> Will a <hi>Lion</hi> roare in the <hi>foreſt,</hi> vnleſſe he hath a prey? <hi>Idem eſt, ac ſi dicet,</hi> It is as if he ſaid, Is it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of <hi>God,</hi> there to ſpeake, or thither to ſend a Prophet, <hi>where</hi> he knoweth there is none worthy of eternall life? Is it ſeemely, is it any way fit, that <hi>God</hi> ſhould there <hi>vtter his voice,</hi> or ſend his Meſſengers thither, where hee knoweth, there is not any one ordained vnto ſaluation? By all congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of reaſon the anſwer muſt be negatiue; <hi>No,</hi> its altogether vnſeemly; its not any way fit. The <hi>Lion</hi> in the <hi>foreſt</hi> roares not, <hi>vnleſſe he haue his prey.</hi> This expoſition of <hi>Rupertus</hi> is by <hi>Ribera</hi> mentioned with ſome approbation: but <hi>Petrus à Figueiro</hi> ſaith, it is <hi>nimis violenta,</hi> too violent, too far fetched. And well may it be ſo.</p>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1736:364"/> from out the hands of <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> or <hi>Nabuchodonozor.</hi> But this application of his is not ſo fit for this place, becauſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is here ſpoken, it is ſpoken not to the people of <hi>Iudah,</hi> but to the people of the <hi>ten Tribes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If great <hi>Albert</hi> muſt be followed, this <hi>Lion</hi> muſt be <hi>vel Deus comminans, vel meliùs inimi us inuadens, vel homo, vel Diabolus.</hi> This <hi>Lion</hi> muſt be either <hi>God</hi> threatning, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome <hi>enemy</hi> inuading, be he <hi>man</hi> or <hi>Deuill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Deuill</hi> muſt be this <hi>Lion</hi> in the conſtruction of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, as <hi>Carthuſian</hi> hath obſerued, for as much as the <hi>Deuill</hi> like a <hi>roaring Lion</hi> walketh about ſeeking whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure, <hi>Semperque ſitit animarum damnationem, &amp; rugit vt eas deglutiat,</hi> and euer thirſteth of the damnation of the ſoules of men, and <hi>roareth</hi> that he may ſwallow them vp. I may not deny, but that the <hi>Deuill</hi> for his extreme fierceneſſe and cruelty ioyned with force and hurt to annoy mankind, is by Saint <hi>Peter</hi> likened to a <hi>Lion,</hi> to <hi>a roaring Lion;</hi> yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not thinke that he is the <hi>Lion</hi> in my Text; no, though this in my Text be <hi>a roaring Lion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But may not ſome <hi>man,</hi> an <hi>enemy,</hi> a <hi>tyrant,</hi> an <hi>oppreſſor,</hi> one or more, be meant by this <hi>Lion,</hi> this <hi>roaring Lion</hi> in my Text? Its not to be doubted, but that ſuch are diuers times in the holy Scriptures compared to <hi>Lions.</hi> The wicked man, who is euermore an <hi>enemy</hi> to the godly, is likened to a <hi>Lion, Pſal.</hi> 10.9. He <hi>lieth in wait ſecretly as a Lion in his den;</hi> he lieth in wait <hi>to catch the poore. Dauids</hi> enemies are as <hi>Lions;</hi> He ſo ſpeakes of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.13. <hi>They gaped vpon mee with their mouthes, as a rauening and a roaring Lion.</hi> Tyrants and oppreſſors of the Church are as Lions. Such a one was <hi>Nero,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls him a <hi>Lion,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17. <hi>I was,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>deliuered out of the mouth of the Lion.</hi> The <hi>Lion,</hi> not the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,</hi> as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith; nor <hi>Feſtus</hi> the Preſident of <hi>Iudaea,</hi> as <hi>Primaſius</hi> affirmeth: but <hi>Nero,</hi> proud and cruell <hi>Nero,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting <hi>Nero,</hi> as its expounded by <hi>Chryſoſtome, Theodoret, Theophylact, Oecumenius, Aquinas,</hi> and <hi>Euſebius, Hiſt. Eccleſ. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 22. Be it then granted, that <hi>Men,</hi> enemies to the godly, Tyrants and oppreſſors are in holy Scripture ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1736:364"/> compared to <hi>Lions;</hi> yet can it not thence be inferred, that therefore by this <hi>roaring Lion</hi> in my Text, <hi>Men</hi> are to be vnderſtood.</p>
                  <p>It remaineth then, that <hi>God</hi> either ſolely or principally be here intended. <hi>Sic communiter omnes intelligunt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtophorus à Caſtre.</hi> So doe all Expoſitors commonly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this Text: that <hi>God</hi> ſhould be this <hi>Lion.</hi> And not only the <hi>old Lion,</hi> but the <hi>young one</hi> too. God is compared to both, as wel to the <hi>young Lion</hi> as to the <hi>old.</hi> To both he is compared, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.14. There thus ſaith the <hi>Lord: I will be vnto Ephraim as a Lion, and as a young Lion to the houſe of Iudah. I, euen I will teare and goe away: I will take away, and none ſhall reſcue him.</hi> So likewiſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 31.4. Thus hath the <hi>Lord</hi> ſpoken: <hi>Like as the Lion and the young Lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of Shepherds is called forth againſt him, hee will not be afraid of their voice, nor abaſe himſelfe for the noiſe of them:</hi> ſo <hi>ſhall the Lord of hoſts come downe to fight for mount Sion and for the hill thereof.</hi> In both places you ſee, <hi>God</hi> is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not onely to the <hi>old Lion,</hi> but to the <hi>young one</hi> too, to the <hi>Lions whelpe.</hi> So is he here in this Text of mine. Now the meaning is; <hi>As a Lion will not roare in the foreſt, except hee hath a prey,</hi> nor <hi>the young Lion cry out of his denne, except he hath gotten ſomewhat:</hi> No more will <hi>Almighty</hi> God <hi>roare from Sion,</hi> or <hi>vtter his voice from Ieruſalem,</hi> except there be <hi>a prey</hi> ready for him: He will not by his Prophets and Miniſters giue forth his <hi>threatnings,</hi> except there be iuſt cauſe for him, to be auenged vpon a people for their ſinnes. My obſeruation is:
<q>If by our ſinnes we prouoke Gods wrath againſt vs, wee ſhall finde that his threatning of vs will not be in vaine.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The threatnings of God, they are not <hi>vana dunt axat puero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſimpliciſque ruſticitatis terricula,</hi> as <hi>Quadratus</hi> hath well noted, they are not onely as <hi>ſcar-crowes</hi> or <hi>bugs</hi> for the terrifying of little children and the ruder ſort of people; but are certaine euidences of Gods reſolution for the puniſhment of ſinne. Neuer are they in vaine.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>two ſorts</hi> they are: for either they concerne a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> and <hi>eternall</hi> puniſhment; or a puniſhment, that is <hi>temporary</hi> and <hi>corporall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:1736:365"/>
                  <p>Of the firſt ſort is that <hi>commination, Deut.</hi> 27.26. <hi>Curſed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this Law to doe them.</hi> The puniſhment there threatned is <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> it is <hi>eternall.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſo expounds it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. where he ſaith: <hi>As many as are of the workes of the Law, are vnder the curſe:</hi> for it is written, <hi>Curſed is euery one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Booke of the Law to doe them.</hi> The curſe there ſpoken of is no <hi>temporall,</hi> no <hi>corporall</hi> matter, it is <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> it is <hi>eternall.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe the <hi>curſe</hi> is oppoſed to the <hi>bleſſing.</hi> Now to bee <hi>bleſſed</hi> with faithfull <hi>Abraham,</hi> is to be <hi>iuſtified,</hi> to bee <hi>abſolued</hi> from ſinne and death, to be in fauour with God, to obtaine eternall ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore to be <hi>accurſed,</hi> is to be <hi>condemned</hi> for ſinne, to be caſt out from God, to be adiudged to euerlaſting death and Hell. The bleſſing is <hi>ſpirituall</hi> and <hi>eternall,</hi> and therefore muſt the curſe alſo be <hi>ſpirituall</hi> and <hi>eternall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Comminations</hi> of the ſecond ſort are in holy Writ more frequent and obuious. If you will <hi>not hearken</hi> to the <hi>Lord</hi> your God to doe his Commandements, but will deſpight his ſtatutes and abhorre his iudgements, then will the <hi>Lord</hi> doe thus and thus vnto you. In the 26. of <hi>Leuit. verſ.</hi> 16. he will viſit you with <hi>vexations, conſumptions,</hi> and <hi>burning agues,</hi> that ſhall <hi>conſume your eyes,</hi> and <hi>cauſe you ſorrow of heart. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſ.</hi> 17. he will <hi>ſet his face againſt you,</hi> and ye <hi>ſhall bee ſlaine before your enemies:</hi> they that hate you <hi>ſhall reigne ouer you,</hi> and ye ſhall flee <hi>when none purſueth you. Verſ.</hi> 19. Hee will <hi>breake the pride of your power,</hi> and will make <hi>your Heauen as iron,</hi> and <hi>your Earth as braſſe:</hi> and <hi>your ſtrength ſhall be ſpent in vaine;</hi> for, neither ſhall your land <hi>yeeld her encreaſe,</hi> nor your trees <hi>their fruits. Verſ.</hi> 22. Hee will ſend <hi>wilde beaſts among you which ſhall rob you of your children,</hi> and <hi>deſtroy your cattell,</hi> and <hi>make you few in number.</hi> Theſe and other like threatnings againſt the wilfull contemners of Gods holy Will you may better read of in the now alleaged 26. Chapter of <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> and 28. Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and other places of holy Scripture, than I can at this time ſtand vpon to relate them. They are many: they are fearefull. Many and fearefull
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1736:365"/> are the puniſhments, though but <hi>temporary</hi> and <hi>corporall,</hi> which the <hi>Lord</hi> threatneth to the wilfull contemners of his holy Will.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee, Gods threatnings are of <hi>two ſorts;</hi> either of <hi>ſpirituall</hi> and <hi>eternall</hi> puniſhments, or puniſhments that are <hi>temporary</hi> and <hi>corporall.</hi> Theſe threatnings of puniſhments, <hi>corporall</hi> or <hi>ſpirituall, temporary</hi> or <hi>eternall,</hi> are by the Lord himſelfe accompliſhed at times certaine and vnchangeable.</p>
                  <p>When the old world in the daies of <hi>Noah</hi> had growne to much impiety and wickedneſſe, the <hi>Lord</hi> appointed a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſpace, the <hi>ſpace of</hi> 120. yeeres for their repentance and conuerſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. <hi>My ſpirit ſhall not alwaies ſtriue with man,</hi> for that <hi>he alſo is fleſh:</hi> yet <hi>his daies ſhall be an hundred and twenty yeeres.</hi> Though he ſaw, that the wickedneſſe of man was great in the earth, and that <hi>euery imagination of the thoughts of his heart</hi> was <hi>euill,</hi> was <hi>onely euill,</hi> was <hi>euill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,</hi> ſo that with great iuſtice he might forthwith haue ſwallowed them vp with a <hi>floud,</hi> yet would hee not, but would yet forbeare longer, and looke for their amendment. A <hi>hundred</hi> and <hi>twenty</hi> yeeres yet would he giue them, to ſee if they would returne and auoid his wrath. But they would not returne, and therefore at the very end and terme of thoſe <hi>hundred</hi> and <hi>twenty</hi> yeeres he brought the <hi>floud</hi> vpon them. Then, then, and not before, he brought the <hi>floud</hi> vpon them. For compare we the particular circumſtances of time noted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.3, 6, 11. with that which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> writeth in his <hi>firſt Epiſtle, chap.</hi> 3.20. we ſhall finde, that the inundation of waters came vpon the earth at the very point of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determined.</p>
                  <p>Memorable is that commination of the <hi>Lord</hi> againſt the <hi>Iewes, Ierem.</hi> 25.11. <hi>Becauſe you haue not heard my voice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I will take from you the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladneſſe, the voice of the bridegroome, and the voice of the bride, the ſound of the Milſtones, and the light of the candle:</hi> you ſhall be a <hi>deſolation,</hi> and <hi>an aſtoniſhment,</hi> &amp; ſhall <hi>ſerue the King of Babylon ſeuenty yeeres.</hi> The ſumme of the Commination is, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> for their ſins ſhould be led captiue, &amp; ſerue the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1736:366"/> King of <hi>Babylon ſeuenty yeeres.</hi> Now if we take the iuſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of time, it will appeare that ſo ſoone as thoſe <hi>yeeres,</hi> thoſe <hi>ſeuenty yeeres</hi> were expired, the foreſaid threat was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. And therefore <hi>Daniel</hi> alluding to this propheſie of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> exactly ſetteth it downe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.30. ſaying, <hi>The ſame night was Belſhazzar King of the Chaldeans ſlaine,</hi> the ſame night, the very night wherein thoſe <hi>ſeuenty yeeres</hi> came to their full period, was <hi>Belſhazzar King of the Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſlaine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To theſe fearefull examples of <hi>Noahs</hi> floud, and the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of the <hi>Iewes</hi> into <hi>Babylon,</hi> may be added the <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of <hi>Sodome</hi> by fire and brimſtone, the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of the <hi>ten Tribes,</hi> the <hi>ruine</hi> of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah,</hi> the <hi>deſolation</hi> of the ſeuen Churches of <hi>Aſia;</hi> all which, beſides many other calamities vpon many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and perſons, accompliſhed and come to paſſe according to the threatnings of the <hi>Lord,</hi> may well aſſure vs, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he hath <hi>threatned,</hi> will certainly <hi>take effect.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if we by ſerious and true repentance doe not <hi>preuent</hi> the execution of his <hi>threats,</hi> he will not faile to <hi>preuent</hi> vs, and take vs away ſuddenly. Thus is my obſeruation made good;
<q>If by our ſinnes we prouoke Gods wrath againſt vs, wee ſhall finde that his threatning of vs will not be in vaine.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>No, it will not. If <hi>God threaten,</hi> and no <hi>repentance</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, then certainly the <hi>threatnings</hi> pronounced will come to paſſe. Hee <hi>threatens</hi> not in vaine; hee terrifies not without cauſe; no more than the <hi>Lion roareth</hi> when he hath no prey, or the <hi>Lions whelpe</hi> cryeth out of his denne if he haue gotten nothing.</p>
                  <p>Is it thus, Beloued? Shall we finde that <hi>Gods threatnings</hi> will be <hi>effectuall</hi> and <hi>powerfull</hi> againſt vs, if we by our ſinnes goe on ſtill to prouoke him to diſpleaſure? It ſeemes then, that if we <hi>repent</hi> vs of our ſinnes, and ceaſe any further to grieue Gods holy Spirit, his <hi>threatnings</hi> will bee <hi>vaine</hi> and without effect. Vnderſtand wee therefore, that the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and denuntiations of Gods iudgements are either
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1736:366"/> 
                     <hi>abſolute</hi> or <hi>conditionall.</hi> If <hi>abſolute,</hi> then are they <hi>irreuocable,</hi> and muſt take effect: but if <hi>conditionall,</hi> then vpon humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and repentance they will bee changed, they will bee altered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abſolute</hi> was the denunciation that concerned the eating of the forbidden fruit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> This threatning was <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>peremptory,</hi> not to be reuoked. If <hi>Adam</hi> had prayed all his life long that he might not die, but returne to his former condition, yet the ſentence of God had not beene reuerſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peremptory</hi> and <hi>abſolute</hi> was that threatning of the <hi>Lord</hi> againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Numb.</hi> 20.12. <hi>Becauſe yee beleeue me not to ſanctifie me in the eyes of the children of Iſrael, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye ſhall not bring this congregation into the land which I haue giuen them. Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> both are threatned that they ſhall neuer enter into the land of <hi>Canaan. Moſes</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the threat <hi>conditionally,</hi> beſought the <hi>Lord</hi> that hee might goe ouer <hi>Iordan</hi> into that good land. But the <hi>Lord</hi> was wroth with him, and would not heare him; but ſaid vnto him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 3.26. <hi>Let it ſuffice thee, ſpeake no more vnto me of this matter.</hi> Speake no more: the ſentence was <hi>peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> and might not be reuerſed.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>peremptory</hi> was that threatning by <hi>Nathan</hi> from the <hi>Lord</hi> vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Becauſe by thine adultery thou haſt giuen great occaſion to the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme, the childe alſo that is borne vnto thee ſhall ſurely dye.</hi> The childe ſhall <hi>ſurely die. Dauids</hi> hope was, that this threat was but <hi>conditionall,</hi> and therefore with faſting, weeping, and prayer he beſought God <hi>for the child,</hi> and ſaid; <hi>Who can tell whether God will be gracious vnto mee, that the child may liue?</hi> Yet, as the <hi>Prophet</hi> had denounced, the <hi>child</hi> died. So <hi>peremptory</hi> was the ſentence, and not to be reuerſed. So then its euident, that ſome of Gods iudgements denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt the ſonnes of men are <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>peremptory,</hi> not to be reuerſed.</p>

                  <p>Sometimes the <hi>condition</hi> is not expreſſed, but onely to be vnderſtood. So is it, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 26.18. There we reade of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah</hi> the <hi>Moruſhite,</hi> that he in the daies of <hi>Hezekiah King of Iudah,</hi> propheſied and ſpake to all the people of <hi>Iudah</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Thus ſaith the <hi>Lord of hoſts; Zion ſhall be plowed like a field, and Ieruſalem ſhall become heapes, and the mountaine of the houſe, the high places of a foreſt.</hi> Fearefull is the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;</hi> it threatens <hi>ruine</hi> to their Temple, <hi>deſolation</hi> to their City, the <hi>vtter ouerthrow</hi> of their whole Kingdome. How did the King and his people hereupon behaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues? Did they fall into deſperation? No, they did not. Did they conclude an impoſſibility of obtaining pardon? Nor did they ſo. How then? They conceiuing aright of the <hi>commination,</hi> as fearefull as it was, that it was vnto them a <hi>Sermon of repentance,</hi> they feared the Lord, they beſought the Lord: and the Lord repented him of the euill which hee had pronounced againſt them.

                  <p>The like we meet with, <hi>Eſay</hi> 38.1. There is a commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory

                  <p>And ſuch is that in the Propheſie of <hi>Ionah, Chap.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Yet forty daies, and Nineueh ſhall be ouerthrowne.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Nineueh,</hi> though an heathen and an idolatrous <hi>King,</hi> yet conceiues aright of this threat, that it was to him and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, no otherwiſe <hi>than a Sermon of repentance.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> therefore touched with repentance, vnſeateth himſelfe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throneth himſelfe, commeth as low as the meaneſt, ſtrips himſelfe of his kingly robes, puts on ſack-cloth, ſits in aſhes; cauſeth it to be proclaimed and publiſhed through <hi>Niniueh,</hi> that there be a <hi>generall faſt</hi> kept by <hi>man</hi> and <hi>beaſt,</hi> that <hi>man</hi> and <hi>beaſt</hi> be couered with <hi>ſack-cloth,</hi> and <hi>cry mightily</hi> vnto <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>turne euery one from his euill way,</hi> and <hi>from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that is in their hands:</hi> for, ſaith the King, <hi>Who can tell, if God will turne and repent, and turne away from his fierce an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that we periſh not?</hi> Who can tell? And God <hi>ſaw their workes,</hi> that <hi>they turned from their euill way,</hi> and God <hi>repented of the euill that he had ſaid that he would doe vnto them,</hi> and he did it not. So alſo was this commination <hi>conditionall,</hi> though the <hi>condition</hi> was not expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>But why are theſe and many other threatnings of the Lord againſt ſinners <hi>conditionall?</hi> Why are they with <hi>condition</hi> of amendment? Why is the <hi>condition</hi> either <hi>expreſſed,</hi> or <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed</hi> and only incluſiuely vnderſtood?</p>
                  <p>Its thus, Firſt, becauſe <hi>Repentance,</hi> if it follow after Gods comminatory ſentence pronounced againſt ſinners, it procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth forgiueneſſe of ſin, and taketh away the cauſe of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1736:368"/> The <hi>cauſe</hi> of puniſhment is <hi>ſinne;</hi> remoue the <hi>cauſe,</hi> and the <hi>effect</hi> muſt ceaſe. Let <hi>ſinne</hi> be waſhed away with the teares of <hi>vnfained repentance,</hi> and puniſhment ſhall neuer hurt vs. This is it, which but euen now you heard out of <hi>Ezech. chap.</hi> 33.14.15. They were the words of the <hi>Lord; When I ſay vnto the wicked, Thou ſhalt ſurely die, if he turne from his ſinne, and doe that which is lawfull and right; if he reſtore the pledge, and giue againe that he hath robbed,</hi> and <hi>walke in the ſtatutes of life without committing iniquitie,</hi> he ſhall <hi>ſurely liue, he ſhall not die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>threatnings</hi> of God againſt ſinners are for the moſt part <hi>conditionall,</hi> becauſe he is a God of mercies, a <hi>gracious</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.15. <hi>Exod</hi> 34.6. <hi>Numb</hi> 14.18. <hi>Pſal</hi> 103.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.8.</note> God, a God of <hi>long ſuffering,</hi> and <hi>much patience,</hi> a God of vnſpeakable kindneſſe, euer ready to receiue vs to mercy, as ſoone as we <hi>returne</hi> vnto him. This is it that the Lord commandeth to be proclaimed by <hi>Ieremy, chap.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Returne thou back-ſliding Iſrael, ſaith the Lord,</hi> and <hi>I will not cauſe mine anger to fall vpon you,</hi> for <hi>I am mercifull,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>I will not keepe mine anger for euer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the threatnings of God againſt ſinners are euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more <hi>conditionall,</hi> becauſe in his threatnings God aimeth not at the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of them that are <hi>threatned,</hi> but at their <hi>amendment.</hi> Their <hi>amendment</hi> is the thing he aimeth at. Its plaine by that, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18.23. <hi>Haue I any pleaſure at all, that the wicked ſhould die, ſaith the Lord God? and not, that he ſhould returne from his waies and liue?</hi> This by way of queſtion. But its out of queſtion and confirmed by oath, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 23.11. <hi>As I liue, ſaith the Lord God, I haue no pleaſure in the death of the wicked,</hi> but <hi>that the wicked turne from his way and liue: turne ye,</hi> turne ye <hi>from your euill waies,</hi> for <hi>why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> Why will ye die? <hi>Returne</hi> and <hi>liue,</hi> I take <hi>no pleaſure</hi> in your death.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto you haue heard of Gods threatnings, that they are of <hi>puniſhments</hi> either <hi>corporall</hi> or <hi>ſpirituall;</hi> either <hi>temporall</hi> or <hi>eternall:</hi> and that they are either <hi>abſolute</hi> or <hi>conditionall;</hi> and if <hi>conditionall,</hi> that then the <hi>condition</hi> is either <hi>expreſſed</hi> or only vnderſtood; Expreſſed or vnderſtood, and that for three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1736:368"/> firſt, becauſe <hi>repentance</hi> waſhes away ſinne, the cauſe of puniſhment: ſecondly, becauſe God is <hi>mercifull,</hi> and will not keepe his wrath for euer: thirdly, becauſe he aimeth eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at the <hi>amendment</hi> of the wicked. It is now time that we make ſome profitable vſe hereof.</p>
                  <p>Our firſt vſe may be, to conſider that in the greateſt and moſt fearefull <hi>threatnings</hi> of Gods heauy iudgements there is comfort remaining, hope of grace and mercy to be found, life in death, and health in ſickneſſe, if we <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>amend.</hi> Thus did the <hi>Princes of Iudah</hi> profit by the threatnings of <hi>Ieremy. Ieremie, chap.</hi> 26.6. comes vnto them with a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the Lords owne mouth: <hi>I will make this houſe like Shiloh, and will make this city a curſe to all the nations of the earth.</hi> He threatned deſolation to the Lords houſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to their city: and therefore the Prieſts and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would haue put him to death. But the <hi>Princes of Iudah</hi> were better aduiſed: they pleaded the practiſe and example of <hi>King Hezekiah</hi> for the comfort of himſelfe and the people of his time; and thereby ſtirred vp themſelues to <hi>feare the Lord,</hi> and <hi>to turne from their euill waies.</hi> And thus did the ſame <hi>King Hezekiah</hi> profit at the threatning of <hi>Eſay,</hi> and the <hi>King of Nineueh</hi> at the threatning of <hi>Ionah,</hi> as you haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready heard. They <hi>repented</hi> of their euill waies, and God <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented</hi> of the euils which he threatned to bring vpon them; and he brought them not vpon them.</p>
                  <p>Here we are to meet with an <hi>obiection.</hi> The <hi>obiection</hi> is: <hi>If God threaten one thing, and doth another,</hi> if he threaten to bring euill vpon any one, and repents him of the euill, it may ſeeme his will is changeable, or he hath <hi>two wills.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For anſwer I ſay, The <hi>will</hi> of God is euer <hi>one</hi> and the ſame, as God is one: but for our capacities and for the weakneſſe of our vnderſtandings, who cannot conceiue how God doth after a diuers manner <hi>will</hi> and <hi>not will</hi> the ſame thing; the <hi>will of God</hi> is called ſometimes <hi>ſecret</hi> or <hi>hidden,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>reuealed,</hi> as the <hi>Church</hi> is called ſometimes <hi>viſible,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>inuiſible,</hi> yet is but <hi>one Church.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29.</note> The <hi>ſecret will</hi> of God is of things <hi>hidden</hi> in himſelfe, and <hi>not manifeſted</hi> in his
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1736:369"/> word: the <hi>reuealed</hi> is of things <hi>made knowne</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or by daily experience. The <hi>ſecret will</hi> is without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; its abſolute, its peremptory, its alwaies fulfilled; no man hindreth it,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.19.</note> no man ſtoppeth it: the very reprobate, yea the Deuils themſelues are ſubiect vnto it. His <hi>reuealed will</hi> is with condition; and therefore for the moſt part is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with exhortation, admonition, inſtruction, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion. Now to the obiection, my anſwer is: Though God threaten <hi>one thing</hi> and doth <hi>another,</hi> though he threaten <hi>to bring euill</hi> vpon any one, and repents him of the euill, yet is not his <hi>will</hi> therefore <hi>changeable,</hi> nor hath he <hi>two wils:</hi> but his <hi>will</hi> is euer <hi>one</hi> and the ſame. The ſame will is in diuers reſpects <hi>hidden</hi> and <hi>reuealed:</hi> Its <hi>ſecret</hi> at firſt before it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed: but as it is <hi>made knowne</hi> to vs either by the written Word of God, or by the continuall ſucceſſe of things, ſo it is called the <hi>reuealed will</hi> of God. Our duty in regard of the <hi>will of God,</hi> as it is <hi>ſecret</hi> or <hi>hidden,</hi> is not curiouſly to pry into it, but reuerently to adore it. Whatſoeuer this <hi>ſecret,</hi> this <hi>hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den will of God</hi> is concerning vs, whether to liue or die, to be rich or poore, to be of high eſtimation or of meane account in this world, it is our part to reſt in the ſame, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and giue leaue to him that made vs to doe with vs and diſpoſe of vs at his pleaſure; and then aftewards, when by the continuall ſucceſſe of things it ſhall be <hi>reuealed</hi> vnto vs, what our lot, our portion, our expectation here muſt bee; much more are we to be therewith contented, and to giue thankes to God, howſoeuer it fareth with vs.</p>
                  <p>The obiection thus anſwered, our recourſe ſhould be to the profit, that is yet further to be made by the <hi>threatnings</hi> of Gods iudgements. You haue heard that in the greateſt and moſt fearefull, there is comfort remaining, hope of grace and mercy to be found; health in ſickneſſe, and life in death, if we repent and amend. I proceed to a ſecond vſe.</p>
                  <p>It concernes the duty of the <hi>Miniſter.</hi> Its our duty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound vnto you the <hi>threatnings</hi> of the Lord with <hi>condition.</hi> Should we propound them <hi>without condition,</hi> we ſhould be, as if we went about to bring you to deſpaire, and to take from
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1736:369"/> you all hope of mercy and forgiueneſſe. We therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them with <hi>condition,</hi> with condition of <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>amendment</hi> of life: and doe offer vnto you grace and mercy, to as many of you as be humble and broken-hearted. Thus we preach not onely the <hi>Law,</hi> but alſo with the <hi>Law</hi> the <hi>Goſpell:</hi> thus we <hi>bind</hi> and <hi>looſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.19.</note> thus we <hi>reteine</hi> and <hi>forgiue</hi> ſins. We preach, and by our preaching we <hi>ſhut</hi> vp the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heauen againſt the obſtinate ſinner, but doe <hi>open</hi> the ſame to euery one that is truly penitent. The third followeth.</p>
                  <p>It concerneth you, You Beloued, you and euery one that hath this grace and fauour with God, to be a hearer of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Word. Its your duty whenſoeuer you heare the <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Gods iudgements againſt ſinners,</hi> to ſtirre vp your ſelues to repentance and to the amendment of your liues. So ſhall you preuent his wrath and ſtay his iudgements. O! take heed beloued, that you <hi>ruſh not on, as the horſe in the day of battell,</hi> to your owne deſtruction. If the Lord God from out of <hi>Sion</hi> ſhall <hi>roare,</hi> as a <hi>Lion roareth in the foreſt when he hath taken a prey;</hi> if he ſhall <hi>vtter his voice from Hieruſalem, as a young Lion couching in his denne,</hi> cryeth out when he hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſomewhat; will it not then be <hi>too late</hi> for vs to returne vnto him? Neuer is it <hi>too late</hi> to returne to God, ſo it be done truly, ſeriouſly, and from the ground of the heart. But this be we well aſſured of, that if there be <hi>no change</hi> in vs, it will be in vaine for vs to looke for a <hi>change</hi> from God. Its certaine, God will neuer <hi>change</hi> his <hi>threatnings,</hi> except we <hi>change</hi> our liues and conuerſations.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore (dearely beloued) ſuffer we a word of exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for concluſion of all. I will deliuer it in the Lords owne words, his words to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Ieremy chap.</hi> 4.1, 4. <hi>If thou wilt returne,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord, returne vnto me:</hi> and <hi>if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my ſight, then ſhalt thou not remoue. Circumciſe your ſelues to the Lord, and take away the fore-skinnes of your hearts, leſt my fury come forth like fire, and burne that none can quench it, becauſe of the euill of your doings. Waſh thine heart from wickedneſſe, that thou maiſt be ſaued; how long ſhall thy vaine thought lodge within thee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:1736:370"/>
                  <p>O come, ſee and taſte, how good and gracious the Lord is vnto vs, how ſeriouſly he exhorteth vs, how ſweetly he inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs to turne vnto him, how louingly he calls vs to repent, and amend our liues that we may be ſaued. Beloued, nothing is wanting, but what is wanting on our parts: and that is the reall performance of true and vnfained repentance through a liuely faith in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus:</hi> Concerning which let me giue you a <hi>rule,</hi> a rule that is grounded and infallible; <hi>Without repentance there is no ſaluation,</hi> without <hi>ſorrow</hi> for ſinne there is no repentance; without <hi>earneſt prayer</hi> there is no ſorrow, no godly ſorrow, and without a <hi>due feeling</hi> of the Lords wrath, there is no prayer that can pierce the skie or moue the Lord. O therefore let vs pray for <hi>repentance,</hi> let vs ſue for <hi>repentance,</hi> let vs worke for <hi>repentance,</hi> let vs beſtow all wee haue vpon <hi>repentance.</hi> All we haue! Its nothing to thee, O Lord. We feele, O Lord, ſuch a benummedneſſe in our hearts, ſuch a dulneſſe in our ſoules, that albeit we ſee our ſinnes, and know them to be exceeding great, yet cannot we ſo bemone them, ſo lament them, ſo grieue at them, ſo deteſt them as we ſhould. Smite, O gracious God, ſmite we beſeech thee, our <hi>flinty hearts,</hi> make them euen to melt within vs at the ſight of our owne tranſgreſſions, that ſo being clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the filthineſſe of ſin, we may grow vp vnto full holineſſe in thy feare through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord and Sauiour.</p>

                     <hi>O quàm vilium ſimilitudines rerum, quam pretioſum praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant ſacramentum!</hi> O, ſaith <hi>Rupertus,</hi> how vile are the things from which <hi>ſimilitudes</hi> may be taken, and how precious the <hi>myſteries,</hi> that may thereby be publiſhed! This our Prophet <hi>de paſtoralibus aſſumptus,</hi> once a ſhepherd, now called to be a diſpenſer of the ſecrets of God, is content to diſpenſe them, by drawing <hi>ſimilitudes</hi> from ſuch things, as he was wont to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue in his ſhepherds walke. Such is that in the <hi>firſt Chapter,</hi> verſ. 2. <hi>The Lord will roare from Zion:</hi> and that in the ſame verſe, <hi>the habitations of the ſhepherds ſhall mourne;</hi> and that in the verſe before my text, <hi>will a Lion roare in the forreſt, when he hath no prey;</hi> and this in my text, <hi>Can a bird fall in a ſnare vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, where no ginne is for him?</hi> All you ſee are paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. <hi>Sufficiunt coeleſti magiſterio res non ſolùm piſcatorum, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rùm etiam paſtorum, vt per eorum ſimilitudines docti ſint &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceant conuenienter gloriam rerum caeleſtium.</hi> Things that fall within the knowledge not only of <hi>fiſhers,</hi> but alſo of <hi>ſhepherds,</hi> are auaileable to diuine inſtruction, that by the <hi>ſimilitudes</hi> of both, <hi>fiſhers,</hi> and <hi>ſhepherds,</hi> the glory of things celeſtiall may be manifeſted.</p>
                  <p>Such is this paſtorall <hi>ſimilitude:</hi> this <hi>ſimilitude</hi> of birds not falling into a <hi>ſnare vpon the earth,</hi> vnleſſe by the fowlers art ſome ginne be ſet for him. It ſerueth for the adumbration of <hi>Gods wonderfull prouidence:</hi> thus. As <hi>ſnares,</hi> wherewith birds are catched, <hi>fall not on the ground at all aduentures and by chance;</hi> but are laid by the skill, induſtry and fore-ſight of the fowler: ſo <hi>the calamities and miſeries of this life,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with men are vſually taken and <hi>ſnared,</hi> come not <hi>by chance,</hi> but are ſent among vs by the <hi>certaine counſell of God,</hi> by his iuſt iudgement, by his diuine prouidence.</p>

                  <p>Two <hi>Hebrew</hi> Rabbins, <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> apply this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude to the <hi>execution</hi> of the <hi>decree</hi> of God and his <hi>ſentence:</hi> thus: If men whoſe dwellings are vpon the earth, can by their cunning and induſtry cauſe the <hi>birds of the aire</hi> to deſcend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, and ſo <hi>fall into their ſnares,</hi> from whence there is no euaſion for them: how much more ſhall I, <hi>I</hi> the <hi>Lord,</hi> who haue my habitation in the Heauen of Heauens, bring men themſelues within the <hi>ſnare</hi> of my <hi>decree</hi> and <hi>ſentence,</hi> that there ſhall be no eſcaping for them?</p>
                  <p>Some ſo apply this ſimilitude, that by this <hi>bird</hi> they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a <hi>ſinner,</hi> and by the <hi>ſnare</hi> his <hi>ſinne.</hi> Their explication is: As a <hi>bird</hi> ſhall not fall into a ſnare vpon the earth, vnleſſe ſome <hi>ginne</hi> be laid for him; ſo ſhall not <hi>ſinners</hi> fall into puniſhment, vnleſſe they themſelues make <hi>ſnares</hi> of their owne <hi>ſinnes</hi> to catch themſelues withall. So may they quickly doe; and ſo ſaith <hi>Salomon, Pro.</hi> 5.22. <hi>The wickedneſſe of the vngodly ſhall catch himſelfe,</hi> and <hi>with the ſnares of his owne ſinnes, ſhall he be trapped.</hi> What then? <hi>Vis non capi laqueo?</hi> wouldeſt thou not be taken with the ſnare? <hi>rumpe ac frange laqueum:</hi> the aduice is good; <hi>teare and breake the ſnare.</hi> But how? <hi>Tolle peccatum, &amp; fregiſti laqueum;</hi> take away the <hi>ſinne,</hi> and thou haſt broken the <hi>ſnare.</hi>

                     <hi>Rupertus</hi> ſo vnderſtands this ſimilitude, that he will haue the grace of God herein to be commended. With him this <hi>fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>

                  <p>This his expoſition well meeteth with the <hi>Arminians,</hi> with thoſe new Prophets, who at this day pretending a more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate diuinity, then ours is, as if they came out of <hi>Coeleſtius</hi> his Schoole, haue with their ſophiſmes and ſubtilties much diſquieted the State of the <hi>Belgicke</hi> Churches, chiefly for the point of <hi>diuine Predeſtination</hi> and the <hi>appendices</hi> thereof.</p>

                  <p>But <hi>ex parte Dei</hi> it is otherwiſe.

                  </p>
                  <p>That of Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 9.19. <hi>Who hath reſiſted the will of God?</hi> being an Interrogation of a denier, implying that <hi>no man hath or can reſiſt it,</hi> is in very reaſon it ſelfe moſt certaine. For the <hi>ſuperiour cauſe</hi> can neuer ſuffer of the <hi>inferiour:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if <hi>mans will</hi> ſhould goe about to <hi>reſiſt</hi> or fruſtrate the <hi>will of God,</hi> it were euen againſt reaſon it ſelfe: for then ſhould <hi>Gods will</hi> ſuffer of <hi>mans will;</hi> which is an impoſſibilitie.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath a fit ſaying for the eſtabliſhing of this truth: It is in his booke <hi>De corrept. &amp; grat. cap.</hi> 14. <hi>Deo vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenti ſaluum facere, nullum hominum reſiſtit arbitrium;</hi> If God be <hi>willing</hi> to ſaue a man, no <hi>will of man</hi> can <hi>reſiſt</hi> him. <hi>Sic enim velle &amp; nolle in volentis aut nolentis eſt poteſtate, vt diuinam vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem non impediat, nec ſuperet poteſtatem;</hi> for <hi>to will,</hi> or <hi>not to will,</hi> is ſo in the power of him that <hi>willeth</hi> or <hi>willeth not,</hi> that it neither hindreth the <hi>will of God,</hi> nor ouer-commeth his power.</p>
                  <p>Thus much by occaſion of <hi>Rupertus</hi> his expoſition. Let vs goe on, <hi>Can a bird] Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Carthuſian</hi> will tell you, that this <hi>fowler,</hi> according to the Expoſitors, is either the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,</hi> or <hi>man,</hi> or <hi>God:</hi> and that their <hi>ſnares</hi> are either <hi>Laquaei cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae,</hi> or <hi>Laquaei poena;</hi> either <hi>ſnares</hi> of ſinne, or <hi>ſnares</hi> of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Deuill</hi> is in holy Scripture compared vnto a <hi>fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> I deny not: for I reade of his <hi>wiles, Epheſ.</hi> 6.11. where we are aduiſed to <hi>put on the whole armour of God, that wee may be able to ſtand againſt the wiles of the Deuill.</hi> I reade likewiſe of the <hi>ſnares,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.7. &amp; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26.

                  <p>Nor may it be denied, but that <hi>man</hi> alſo is in holy Scripture compared to a <hi>fowler.</hi> To a <hi>fowler</hi> he is compared in a two-fold reſpect, in reſpect of <hi>others,</hi> and in reſpect of <hi>himſelfe.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Man</hi> is a <hi>fowler</hi> in reſpect of <hi>others.</hi> Hee hath ſnares, and cords, and nets, and grinnes to catch <hi>others</hi> with. Such <hi>fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> were King <hi>Dauids</hi> enemies, his proud enemies, <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Doeg,</hi> of whom, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 140 5. he thus complaineth: <hi>They haue hid</hi> a ſnare <hi>for me,</hi> and cords, <hi>they haue ſpread</hi> a net <hi>by the waies ſide, they haue ſet</hi> ginnes <hi>for me.</hi> And ſuch are they, thoſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 5.26. <hi>They lay wait, as he that ſetteth</hi> ſnares, <hi>they ſet a</hi> trap, <hi>they catch men.</hi> And ſuch are they, of whom the complaint of the faithfull is, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.52. <hi>Mine enemies cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me ſore like a bird, without cauſe.</hi> They <hi>chaſed</hi> me <hi>like a bird.</hi> It is true then, <hi>Men</hi> are <hi>fowlers</hi> in reſpect of <hi>others; fowlers</hi> they are to catch <hi>others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea: and <hi>fowlers</hi> they are in reſpect of <hi>themſelues,</hi> euen to catch themſelues. Such a one is he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.15. <hi>He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.</hi> And he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.15, 16. <hi>In the net which he hid, is his owne foot taken:</hi> he is ſnared <hi>in the work of his owne hands.</hi> And he, <hi>Prou.</hi> 5.22. <hi>His owne iniquities ſhall take himſelfe,</hi> and <hi>he ſhall be holden with the cords of his ſinnes.</hi> Not amiſſe then hath <hi>Carthuſian</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that men ſometimes doe fall, <hi>in laqueum culpae,</hi> into the ſnare of ſinne, by their owne inclination, or naughtineſſe. For as <hi>Origen</hi> witneſſeth; <hi>Quamuis non eſſent Diaboli, adhuc homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes concupiſcentijs pulſarentur:</hi> though there were no <hi>Deuils</hi> at all, yet ſhould men be <hi>enſnared</hi> with their owne luſts.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee, <hi>Man</hi> is a <hi>fowler;</hi> a <hi>fowler</hi> to catch others, and a <hi>fowler</hi> to catch himſelfe: and his ſnares are <hi>laquei culpae,</hi> the ſnares of ſinne. Yet, that <hi>man</hi> is the <hi>fowler</hi> in my text, I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme not.</p>
                  <p>It remaineth then that by this <hi>fowler God</hi> muſt be intended. For <hi>God</hi> is a <hi>fowler</hi> too; and he hath <hi>ſnares</hi> too: but his ſnares are <hi>laquei poenae,</hi> they are <hi>ſnares</hi> of puniſhment. Of <hi>ſnares</hi> of this kinde hee hath no want. <hi>He powres them forth like raine.</hi> This is that we reade, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Vpon the wicked ſhall the Lord raine ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and a burning tempeſt: this
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1736:374"/> ſhall be the portion of their cup.</hi> Behold a <hi>raine</hi> of <hi>ſnares</hi> vpon the wicked. King <hi>Dauid</hi> deuoting his enemies to deſtruction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.22. Wiſheth their table <hi>to become a ſnare vnto them,</hi> and <hi>that which ſhould be for their welfare</hi> to become <hi>a trap vnto them.</hi> The place Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alleageth with ſome little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.9. <hi>Let their table be made a ſnare, and a trap, and a ſtumbling blocke, and a recompence vnto them.</hi> And here behold, a mans owne <hi>table,</hi> and that which ſhould yeeld him much comfort, becomes a <hi>ſnare</hi> and a <hi>trap</hi> for God to entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and catch the wicked with.</p>
                  <p>Remarkable is that of the Prophet <hi>Eſay chap.</hi> 8.14. where it is ſaid of the <hi>Lord of Hoſtes</hi> himſelfe, that to both the houſes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> he ſhall be for <hi>a ſtone of ſtumbling,</hi> and for <hi>a rocke of offences;</hi> and to the inhabitants of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> for <hi>a ginne</hi> and for <hi>a ſnare:</hi> and that many of them ſhall <hi>ſtumble,</hi> and <hi>fall,</hi> and <hi>be broken,</hi> and be <hi>ſnared,</hi> and <hi>be taken.</hi> And here againe behold: The <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> he that is euer to the faithfull a rocke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge and ſaluation, he is to the wicked and the vnbeleeuing <hi>a ginne</hi> and <hi>ſnare</hi> to <hi>enſnare</hi> and <hi>take them with.</hi> It is not to be denied, but that <hi>God</hi> may very well be reſembled to a <hi>fowler.</hi> And him I take to be the <hi>fowler</hi> in my text. Now the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance betweene <hi>God</hi> and a <hi>fowler</hi> ſtands thus: As <hi>ſnares</hi> wherewith <hi>birds</hi> are catched, fall not on the ground <hi>at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures,</hi> and <hi>by chance,</hi> but are laid of <hi>purpoſe by the skill,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie, and fore-ſight <hi>of the fowler:</hi> ſo the <hi>calamities</hi> and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of this life, wherewith men are vſually <hi>taken</hi> and <hi>ſnared,</hi> come not <hi>by chance,</hi> but are ſent among vs <hi>by the prouidence of God.</hi> So this text is, as before I intimated, an adumbration of the <hi>prouidence of God,</hi> by which he ruleth all things.</p>
                  <p>The point of doctrine which from hence I would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vnto you, is this, <hi>Nihil accidere, niſi à Deo prouiſum,</hi> that <hi>nothing falleth out in this life, no calamitie, no miſery, nothing, good or euill, but by Gods prouidence.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>prouidence of God,</hi> this his <hi>actuall</hi> and <hi>tranſient proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> this his <hi>externall action,</hi> and <hi>the execution of his inward and eternall decree,</hi> is nothing elſe than a perpetuall and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable diſpoſition and adminiſtration of all things: or to ſpeake with <hi>Aquinas,</hi> it is nothing elſe, than <hi>ratio ordinis rerum ad finem;</hi> it is nothing elſe, than the courſe which God perpetually holdeth for the ordering of the things of the world to ſome certaine end.</p>
                  <p>Such is the <hi>prouidence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> whereof I am now to ſpeake: w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is by ſome diuided into a <hi>generall,</hi> and a <hi>ſpeciall prouidence:</hi> by others into an <hi>vniuerſall,</hi> a <hi>ſpecial,</hi> &amp; a <hi>particular prouidence.</hi>

                  <p>Gods <hi>vniuerſall</hi> or <hi>generall prouidence,</hi> I call that, by which he doth not only direct al creatures according to that ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, or inward vertue, which he hath giuen to euery one of them, at the time of their creation, but doth alſo preſerue them in their ordinary courſe of nature.</p>
                  <p>Of this <hi>vniuerſall</hi> or <hi>generall prouidence</hi> of God, <hi>Theodoret Biſhop of Cyrus,</hi> in his firſt Sermon concerning this argument, diſcourſeth copiouſly and elegantly: You <hi>that ſay in your hearts</hi> there is <hi>no prouidence of God,</hi> conſider the things that are viſible, and are obuious to your eies, conſider their <hi>nature,</hi> their <hi>ſite,</hi> their <hi>order,</hi> their <hi>ſtate,</hi> their <hi>motion,</hi> their <hi>agreement,</hi> their <hi>harmony,</hi> their <hi>comlineſſe,</hi> their <hi>beautie,</hi> their <hi>magnitude,</hi> their <hi>vſe,</hi> their <hi>delight,</hi> their <hi>variety,</hi> their <hi>alteration,</hi> their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance;</hi> and then, if you can, deny <hi>God's prouidence.

                     <hi>reaſonable,</hi> or <hi>vnreaſonable,</hi> man or beaſt: and in <hi>euery beaſt,</hi> whether it <hi>goeth,</hi> or <hi>flieth,</hi> or <hi>ſwimmeth,</hi> or <hi>creepeth.</hi> There is not any thing, but it may ſerue to magnifie <hi>the prouidence of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why runne I to the Fathers for the illuſtration of a point, wherein the holy Scriptures are ſo plentifull, ſo elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent? The 104. <hi>Pſalme</hi> containeth an egregious deſcription hereof, a faire and goodly picture, and a liuely portraiture of this <hi>prouidence of God,</hi> drawne with the pencill of the holy Ghoſt. I ſee therein the <hi>aire,</hi> and <hi>clouds,</hi> and <hi>winds,</hi> and <hi>water,</hi> and the <hi>earth,</hi> and the like, ſo ruled and ordered by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate hand of God, that, ſhould he remoue his hand but for a moment, this whole vniuerſe would totter, and fall, and come to nothing.</p>
                  <p>I goe on to the 147. <hi>Pſalme;</hi> There I ſee God <hi>numbering</hi> the <hi>ſtarres,</hi> and <hi>calling them by name:</hi> I ſee him <hi>couering</hi> the <hi>Heauens with clouds</hi> preparing <hi>raine for the earth,</hi> giuing <hi>ſnow like wooll,</hi> ſcattering <hi>the hoare froſt like aſhes,</hi> caſting forth <hi>his ice like morſells,</hi> making <hi>graſſe to grow vpon the mountaines,</hi> giuing <hi>food to beaſts,</hi> to <hi>Rauens:</hi> all this I ſee, and cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his <hi>vniuerſall prouidence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I looke backe to the booke of <hi>Iob,</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. I finde God <hi>remouing mountaines,</hi> and <hi>ouer-turning them;</hi> I finde him <hi>ſhaking the earth out of her place,</hi> and commanding <hi>the Sunne to ſtand ſtill:</hi> I finde him alone <hi>ſpreading out the heauens,</hi> and treading <hi>vpon the waues of the ſea:</hi> I finde him making <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturus, O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Infinite are the teſtimonies which I might produce out of the <hi>old Teſtament</hi> for this point: but I paſſe them ouer, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting my ſelfe with only two out of the <hi>new.</hi>

                  <p>That of our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.17. <hi>My Father worketh hitherto, and I worke,</hi> is fit to my purpoſe. The words are an anſwer to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who perſecuted <hi>our Sauiour</hi> and ſought to ſlay him, for doing a cure on the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> vpon one that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1736:375"/> had beene diſeaſed 38. yeares. They held it to be vnlawfull to doe any worke vpon the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day: <hi>Chriſt</hi> affirmes it to be lawfull. The ground of their opinion was; God the Father <hi>reſted the ſeuenth</hi> day from all his workes. This <hi>Chriſt</hi> denieth not, but explicates the meaning of it.

It may be thus enlarged: <hi>Requieuit die ſeptimo,</hi> God reſted the ſeuenth day from creating <hi>any new world,</hi> or from making <hi>any new kinds of creatures,</hi> but nor <hi>then</hi> reſted he, nor <hi>at any time ſince</hi> hath he reſted from <hi>prouiding for,</hi> and <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for,</hi> and <hi>ruling,</hi> and <hi>gouerning,</hi> and <hi>ſuſtaining</hi> the world.

                  <p>The obiections, that are by the ignorant caſt out againſt this holy and comfortable doctrine, I cannot now ſtand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute: they may, if God will, be the ground-worke of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meditation. For the preſent, that I be not ouer-trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome vnto you, I will adde but a word of vſe, and application.</p>
                  <p>The firſt vſe may be, to ſtirre vs vp to glorifie God for all his <hi>mercies.</hi> For ſith we know, that whatſoeuer befalleth vs in this life, it is by <hi>the prouidence of God,</hi> what ſhould come out of our mouthes, and hearts, but that of holy <hi>Iob, Bleſſed, Bleſſed be the name of the Lord for it?</hi> In the time of our proſperity, when the face of the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhineth moſt cheerefully vpon vs, what ſhould pierce the inward parts of a childe of God, but theſe or the like motions? <hi>O Lord!

                  <p>A ſecond vſe may be to worke <hi>patience</hi> in vs, euen through our whole life, and in our greateſt afflictions. For ſith wee know, that whatſoeuer befalleth vs in this life, be it to the fleſh neuer ſo ſowre, it commeth to paſſe by <hi>the prouidence of God;</hi> why ſhould any one that is the childe of God murmure or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, when he is <hi>fed with the bread of teares?</hi>

                     <hi>Luther</hi> for the remouing of this ſcruple here reſpecteth the <hi>intention</hi> of the fowler, not his <hi>labour,</hi> nor the <hi>euent</hi> therof.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Petrus Luſitanus</hi> here obſerueth it to bee the cuſtome of fowlers, <hi>non facilè laqueos amouere,</hi> not willing to remoue their ſnares, till they catch ſomewhat. The like doth <hi>Mercerus, Haud ſaue id moris eſt,</hi> ſurely its not the cuſtome, that a fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſhould take vp his ſnares, if hee haue taken nothing. So doth <hi>Druſius: Non tollitur,</hi> A ſnare is not taken vp, before ſomewhat be catched. <hi>Non tollitur,</hi> that is, <hi>non tolls ſolet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muniter,</hi>

                  <p>It is now eaſie to giue anſwer to the interrogation. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation is, <hi>Shall one,</hi> a man, a fowler, <hi>take vp his ſnare from the ground, and haue taken nothing at all?</hi> The anſwer is, Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no. Commonly, and for the moſt part he doth it not: hee vſeth not, its not his cuſtome to take vp his ſnare from the ground, if he haue taken nothing at all.</p>
                  <p>The reading is cleered, the interrogation is anſwered; and now let vs ſee whereto this <hi>ſimilitude</hi> taken from this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the <hi>fowler</hi> is appliable. It may ſerue, as in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Lecture I ſignified, for the illuſtration of the certainty, the ſtability and the efficacy of the iudgements of God, which he threatneth to bring vpon the wicked for their ſins; thus. A <hi>fowler</hi> vſeth not to <hi>take vp</hi> his <hi>ſnares,</hi> till he hath <hi>catched ſomewhat:</hi> no more is it Gods vſe, when he maketh ſhew of his iudgements, to withdraw his hand, till he hath put them in execution. God giues not forth his threats in vaine, nor gathers he vp his nets, nor takes he vp his ſnares, till he hath taken what he would; till he hath effected what he threatned by his Prophets. The ſumme of all is; <hi>Verbum Dei non ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere fine efficacia.</hi> The word of God falleth not without its
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1736:381"/> efficacy; what he ſpeaketh, that he doth. Such is the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this preſent ſimilitude.</p>

                     </gap> he doth the former. Hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it to ſuch as liue in diſcord and variance. Their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is, <hi>vt capiantur laqueo,</hi> to be taken in a <hi>ſnare;</hi> in a <hi>ſnare,</hi> that is placed not in the aire but on the ground; from which whoſoeuer is deliuered, good cauſe hath he to reioyce; and to ſay as it is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 124.7. <hi>Our ſoule is eſcaped, as a bird out of the ſnare of the fowlers: the</hi> ſnare <hi>is broken, and we are deliuered.</hi> This is <hi>contritus ille laqueus,</hi> that ſame broken ſnare, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20. <hi>Deus conteret Satanam ſub pedibus veſtris velociter;</hi> God ſhall bruiſe, he ſhall breake <hi>Satan</hi> vnder your feet ſhortly.

For they are not able any other way to deceiue the ſimple, then by propounding vnto them the name of Chriſt, <hi>Vt dum putamus nos Chriſtum inuenire, pergamus ad Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum:</hi> the while we thinke we are in the way to finde out <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we goe on the high way to <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> Thus hath Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> applied this ſimilitude: and he is followed by <hi>Strabus Fuldenſis,</hi> the Author of the ordinary Gloſſe.</p>
                  <p>The doctrine which that <hi>good Father</hi> would from hence commend vnto vs is this; <hi>Diſcordiae poena, in laqueum inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere.</hi> It is the puniſhment of <hi>diſcord</hi> to fall into a <hi>ſnare.</hi> I thus explicate it.

                  <p>Muſt <hi>calamity</hi> bee the guerdon, the recompence of the man that liueth in <hi>diſcord</hi> and <hi>variance?</hi> It muſt needs be ſo. The fouleneſſe, the leproſie of this <hi>ſinne</hi> will nor ſuffer it to be otherwiſe. How foule and leprous this <hi>ſinne</hi> is, it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, firſt by the deteſtation wherein God holdeth it. <hi>Six things there are which the Lord hateth, yea the ſeuenth his ſoule abhorreth. A proud looke, a diſſembling tongue, hands that ſhed innocent bloud; an heart that deuiſeth wicked imaginations; feet that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe; a falſe witneſſe, that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1736:381"/> ſpeaketh lies:</hi> Theſe are the <hi>ſix</hi> which the <hi>Lord</hi> hateth: the <hi>ſeuenth</hi> which his ſoule abhorreth is, <hi>Hee that ſoweth diſcord among brethren, Prou.</hi> 6.16. And no maruell is it, that hee ſhould with his ſoule abhorre ſuch a one. <hi>Non enim eſt diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis Deus, ſed pacis,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.33. For <hi>God,</hi> he is not a <hi>God</hi> of <hi>tumult,</hi> of <hi>vnquietneſſe,</hi> of <hi>conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> of <hi>diſſention,</hi> of <hi>diſcord,</hi> but a God of peace.</p>
                  <p>Againe, this <hi>ſinne</hi> appeareth to be very foule and leprous, in that it excludeth from the Kingdome of Heauen. That it doth ſo, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> proueth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19. becauſe it is a <hi>worke</hi> of the <hi>fleſh:</hi> among which he numbreth, <hi>hatred, variance, emulation, wrath, ſtrife,</hi> and <hi>ſeditions:</hi> and concludeth, that <hi>they which doe ſuch things ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third way to finde out the foulneſſe and leproſie of this ſinne, is, to take a view of the appellations, which in holy Scripture are giuen to this kinde of ſinner. He is <hi>carnall,</hi> he is <hi>froward,</hi> he is <hi>proud,</hi> he is <hi>fooliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, he is <hi>Carnall.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> auoucheth it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Ye are yet carnall.</hi> For <hi>whereas there is among you enuying, and ſtrife, and diuiſions, are ye not carnall and walke as men?</hi> Are ye not <hi>carnall?</hi> Deny it not. For you are <hi>carnall,</hi> and ye <hi>walke as men.</hi> You are <hi>carnall,</hi> you follow the force and prouoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your fleſh, your ſenſuality, your concupiſcence, and ye <hi>walke as men:</hi> Ye walke not <hi>after God,</hi> not <hi>after the Spirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.10.</note> not <hi>in the Spirit,</hi> not <hi>worthy of the Lord,</hi> not worthy of the Goſpell; as long as there is among you <hi>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſinner in this kinde is <hi>froward.</hi> So doth <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſtile him, <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ou.</hi> 16.28. <hi>A froward man ſoweth ſtrife.</hi> This <hi>froward</hi> man, in the Hebrew, <hi>Vir peruerſitatum,</hi> A man of frowardneſſes; a man giuen altogether to <hi>frowardneſſe, ſoweth ſtrife betweene</hi> man and man, betweene neighbour and neighbour, and is a very <hi>batemaker.</hi> Wil you a fuller deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him? you may haue it, <hi>Prou.</hi> 6.12. There ſhall you find him to be a <hi>naughty perſon,</hi> a <hi>wicked man,</hi> one <hi>that waketh with a froward mouth,</hi> that <hi>winketh with his eyes,</hi> that <hi>ſpeaketh
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1736:382"/> with his feet,</hi> that <hi>teacheth with his fingers,</hi> that <hi>hath froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in his heart,</hi> that <hi>continually deuiſeth miſchiefe,</hi> that <hi>ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth diſcord.</hi> Beleeue it: it is a ſure marke of a <hi>naughty,</hi> a <hi>wicked,</hi> a <hi>froward</hi> man, to be the Author of <hi>contentions</hi> and <hi>ſtrife.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this kinde of ſinner is a <hi>proud</hi> man. For, as it is, <hi>Prou.</hi> 13.10. <hi>Onely by pride commeth contention.</hi> Onely by <hi>pride?</hi> The meaning is not, that pride is the <hi>onely</hi> cauſe of contention, but one of the chiefeſt. So is that place by ſome expounded. But well may it without gloſſe or expoſition paſſe for a truth, that <hi>onely by pride commeth contention,</hi> if Saint <hi>Auguſtine in his booke de Nat. &amp; Grat. againſt the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians</hi> bee not deceiued. Out of the 26. Chapter of that booke, I thus frame his argument. <hi>Euery contempt of God is pride;</hi> but <hi>euery ſinne is a contempt of God;</hi> Therefore <hi>euery ſinne is pride;</hi> according to that of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus, chap.</hi> 10.15. <hi>Initium omnis peccati eſt ſuper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>a,</hi> The beginning of <hi>euery ſinne</hi> is <hi>pride.</hi> Now if <hi>euery ſinne,</hi> if the beginning of <hi>euery ſinne</hi> be <hi>pride,</hi> then certaine it is, that <hi>contention, variance, ſtrife, debate,</hi> and the like, are all from <hi>pride.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the ſinner in this kinde is a <hi>foole.</hi> For a <hi>foole</hi> he is taken, <hi>Prou.</hi> 18.6. Where it is ſaid; <hi>Labia ſtulti miſcent ſe rixis,</hi> A <hi>fooles</hi> lips are euer brawling. The words which a <hi>foole</hi> vttereth with his lips, haue alwaies <hi>ſtrife</hi> annexed vnto them, as an inſeparable companion.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the account wherein the Spirit of God hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>brawlers, make-bates,</hi> and <hi>ſowers</hi> of <hi>diſcord,</hi> in that it ſtileth them <hi>carnall,</hi> and <hi>froward,</hi> and <hi>proud,</hi> and <hi>fooliſh.</hi> It was the third way, I propounded, to finde out the foulneſſe and leproſie of this <hi>ſinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is yet a fourth way: and that is by the effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as <hi>Buſaeus</hi> the Ieſuite in his <hi>Panary</hi> hath obſerued.</p>
                  <p>One effect thereof is <hi>to increaſe our ſinnes.</hi> Well then doth <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> exhort vs <hi>to abſtaine from ſtrife.</hi> His exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, <hi>Chap.</hi> 28.8. <hi>Abſtaine from ſtrife,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and thou ſhalt <hi>diminiſh thy ſinnes.</hi> If by abſtaining from <hi>ſtrife</hi> we <hi>diminiſh our ſinnes,</hi> then ſurely by <hi>liuing in ſtrife</hi> we <hi>increaſe our ſinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:1736:382"/>
                  <p>A ſecond effect of <hi>ſtrife</hi> he maketh to be the <hi>ſubuerſion</hi> of <hi>the hearers:</hi> according to that charge which <hi>Paul</hi> giueth to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Charge them before the Lord, that they ſtriue not about words to no profit, but to the ſubuerting of the hearers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third effect is, that it <hi>diſturbeth the quietneſſe euen of a wiſe man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon, Prou.</hi> 29.9. A <hi>wiſe man,</hi> if he <hi>contend</hi> with a fooliſh man, there is no quietneſſe for him.</p>
                  <p>A fourth effect is, that it bringeth ruine, deſtruction, and deſolation, not onely to houſes or families, but to Cities alſo, yea to Countries, yea to Kingdomes. This our Sauiour Chriſt ſheweth by a prouerbiall ſaying, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.25. The ſaying is, <hi>Euery Kingdom diuided againſt it ſelfe is brought to deſolation:</hi> and <hi>euery City, or houſe diuided againſt it ſelfe, ſhall not ſtand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such, Beloued, are the effects of this ſinne of <hi>diſcord,</hi> and may well diſcouer vnto you the foulneſſe and leproſie of it. For if it <hi>increaſe our ſinnes,</hi> if it be the <hi>ſubuerſion</hi> of thoſe that heare vs, if it <hi>diſturbe</hi> our quietneſſe, if it bring <hi>ruine, deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and <hi>deſolation</hi> to all eſtates, then ſurely it is a ſoule and a leprous ſinne.</p>
                  <p>And thus haue I led you in foure ſeuerall pathes to finde out the foulneſſe, and leproſie of this ſinne. The firſt was by Gods deteſtation of it. <hi>His ſoule abhorreth it.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was by the gates of Heauen faſt ſhut againſt it; They that ſinne this ſinne <hi>ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God.</hi> The third was by the titles giuen to thoſe ſinners; they are <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi> and <hi>froward,</hi> and <hi>proud,</hi> and <hi>fooliſh.</hi> The fourth was by the effects which this ſinne produceth: it <hi>increaſeth</hi> our faults, it <hi>ſubuerteth</hi> our hearers, it <hi>diſturbeth</hi> our quietneſſe; it brings <hi>deſolation</hi> vpon all, vpon family, vpon nation, vpon Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>You now ſee the foulneſſe; you ſee the leproſie of this ſin; and will yeeld your aſſents to the truth of my propounded doctrine: which was,
<q>The man that liueth in <hi>diſcord</hi> and <hi>variance,</hi> ſhall fall into ſuch calamities, out of which there is no eſcaping for him as there is no eſcaping for a bird out of a ſnare.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:1736:383"/>
                  <p>Is it thus, Beloued? Muſt the man that liues in <hi>diſcord</hi> and <hi>variance</hi> fall into calamities, out of which there is no eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for him? Muſt he? Our beſt way then will be, euer to beare about with vs, that ſame Antidote or preſeruatiue which Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> hath preſcribed, <hi>Offic. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. <hi>Caueatur iracundia, aut ſi pracaueri non poteſt cohibeatur.</hi> Take heed of <hi>wrath,</hi> beware of <hi>diſcord,</hi> or if thou canſt not before hand prouide againſt it, keepe it ſhort, bridle it. But firſt, <hi>Caueatur,</hi> Beware, or take heed of it. This is the counſell which <hi>Paul</hi> giueth in his firſt booke concerning the remedy of loue;
<q>
                        <l>Principijs obſta, ſerò medicina paratur</l>
                        <l>Cum mala per longas inualuere moras.</l>
                     </q> Withſtand <hi>beginnings;</hi> thy medicines may come too late, if thy diſeaſe be grown ſtrong. And this is the third remedy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>Buſaeus</hi> againſt this malady: <hi>Reſiſte contentionum principijs,</hi> Reſiſt the beginnings of diſcord. If thou bee to talke with any man, <hi>keepe vnder</hi> the firſt motions of thy minde, that they breake not forth into indignation; and ſo thou giue the occaſion of <hi>diſcord.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I haue with ſome prolixity inſiſted vpon this argument of <hi>diſcord</hi> and <hi>variance,</hi> the rather being perſwaded of the truth of that which S. <hi>Auguſtin.

                  <p>The motiue that now drew me to entreat of this argument, was Saint <hi>Hieroms</hi> application of my Text to ſuch as liue in <hi>diſcord</hi> and <hi>variance,</hi> whereupon his collection was, <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiae poenam eſſe, in laqueum incidere,</hi> that it is the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>diſcord,</hi> to <hi>fall into a ſnare.</hi> Thus far I haue beene his. I muſt now leaue him, and looke backe to the other appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of my Text, wherewith I acquainted you in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this exerciſe. My Text is:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shall one take vp a ſnare from the earth, and haue taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all.</hi> The application is:</p>
                  <p>A fowler vſeth not to take vp his <hi>ſnares</hi> from the earth; till hee hath catched ſomewhat; No more is it Gods vſe, when he maketh ſhew of his iudgements, to withdraw his hand, till he hath put them in execution. God giues not forth his threats in <hi>vaine,</hi> nor gathers hee vp his nets, nor takes he vp his ſnares, <hi>till hee hath taken what hee would,</hi> till he hath effected what he threatned by his Prophets. The ſumme of all is, <hi>Verbum Dei non cadere fine efficacia:</hi> The Word of God falleth not out without its efficacy. And it is the Doctrine, which I would now further commend vnto your Chriſtian and deuout attentions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Word of God falls not out without its efficacy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:1736:385"/>
                  <p>I thus explicate it. <hi>The Word of God</hi> is a certaine, a ſure, a faithfull word. All the <hi>propheſies,</hi> all the predictions of future things therein propounded, are wonderfully made good in their accompliſhment and euent. All <hi>promiſes</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in made, all <hi>threats</hi> therein denounced are euer true in their performance.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>propheſies,</hi> the predictions of future things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the Word of God are euer true, and haue their due accompliſhment, I ſhall make plaine in few words.</p>
                  <p>In the daies of <hi>Noah</hi> the world was growne ſo foule with ſinne, that God would needs waſh it with a <hi>floud.</hi> With this his purpoſe to waſh the world with a floud, hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted <hi>Noah</hi> one hundred and twenty yeeres before hee ſent the floud. When that time had its period, when thoſe <hi>one hundred and twenty yeeres</hi> were expired, then, euen then, and not before, hee brought in the <hi>floud,</hi> as it appeareth by the collation of <hi>Geneſis</hi> 7.6, 11. with 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.20.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>fifteenth</hi> of <hi>Geneſis, verſ.</hi> 13. God ſaith vnto <hi>Abram: Know of a ſurety, that thy ſeed ſhall be a ſtranger in a land that is not theirs, and ſhall ſerue them, and they ſhall afflict them foure hundred yeeres: and afterward ſhall they come out with great ſubſtance.</hi> Here is a prediction vnto <hi>Abram</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his poſterity; that they ſhould goe into a ſtrange land, ſhould liue in thraldome, and ſhould from thence be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered at the end of <hi>foure hundred yeeres.</hi> According to this prediction it came to paſſe. But firſt I note here, that this time of <hi>foure hundred yeeres,</hi> muſt beginne at the birth of <hi>Iſaak;</hi> though from his<note n="a" place="margin">An. M. <hi>2049.</hi>

Againe, I note here, that by this land, <hi>not theirs,</hi> is meant not <hi>Aegypt</hi> onely, but <hi>Canaan</hi> too. And thirdly I note, that where the Text rehearſeth theſe three, they <hi>ſhall be ſtrangers,</hi> they ſhall <hi>ſerue,</hi> they ſhall <hi>be afflicted;</hi> we muſt iointly, not ſeuerally, apply them all to the time limited of <hi>foure hundred yeeres,</hi> that this whole time of <hi>foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

                     <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the <hi>Sauiour</hi> of mankind was promiſed to our firſt parents, euen vpon the beginning of the world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. where God tells the Serpent, that <hi>the ſeed of the woman</hi> ſhould <hi>bruiſe</hi> his <hi>head.</hi> Hee was promiſed vnto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram, Geneſis</hi> 12.3. <hi>In thee ſhall all the Nations of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> This promiſe vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> is <hi>ſeuen</hi> times rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated.

                  <p>Such is that, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 44.28. There thus ſaith the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> He is <hi>my ſhepheard and ſhall performe all my pleaſure,

Nor was he borne within <hi>one hundred yeeres</hi> after this time. Nay, ſaith <hi>Ioſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus, Antiq.

                  <p>Thus haue I briefly, and in a few inſtances made it plaine, that the <hi>propheſies,</hi> the <hi>predictions</hi> of things to come, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the Word of God, are <hi>euer true,</hi> and <hi>haue their due accompliſhment:</hi> that all the <hi>promiſes</hi> made therein, all the <hi>threats</hi> denounced therein, are <hi>euer true</hi> in their performance. So, true is my doctrine.</p>
                  <q>The Word of God falleth not out without its efficacy.</q>
                  <p>True; For <hi>God</hi> himſelfe hath ſaid it, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.10. <hi>As the raine commeth downe, and ſnow from Heauen, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth, and bud, that it may giue ſeed to the ſower, and bread to the eater:</hi> So <hi>ſhall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it ſhall not returne vnto mee void; but it ſhall accompliſh that which I pleaſe,</hi> and <hi>it ſhall proſper in the thing whereto I ſent it.</hi> By this ſimilitude taken from the <hi>raine</hi> and <hi>ſnow,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> giueth vs to vnderſtand that his Word hath euer an <hi>effectiue power.</hi> It is euer working one way or other.

The <hi>Trumpets</hi> were blowne. Here was much ioy expreſſed; here was no ſhew of <hi>feare</hi> at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Extraordinary</hi> was the ſound of the <hi>Trumpets</hi> at the dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of <hi>Solomons Temple.</hi> Then beſides the <hi>Leuites</hi> who had their <hi>Cymbals</hi> and <hi>Pſalteries</hi> and <hi>Harpes,</hi> there were an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty Prieſts ſounding with <hi>Trumpets,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.12. The <hi>Trumpets</hi> were blowne; much ioy was thereby expreſſed, there was no ſhew of <hi>feare</hi> at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Extraordinary</hi> was the ſound of the <hi>Trumpets</hi> at the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of religion by <hi>Hezekiah</hi> King of <hi>Iudah;</hi> and then were the <hi>Leuites</hi> preſent with their <hi>Cymbals,</hi> their <hi>Pſalteries,</hi> and their <hi>Harpes,</hi> and the <hi>Prieſts</hi> with their <hi>Trumpets,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.26. The <hi>Trumpets</hi> were blowne, ioy was expreſſed, no feare appeared.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee <hi>Trumpets</hi> haue been blowne, not only at ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary times, but alſo at times extraordinary, and yet haue the people had no cauſe of <hi>feare.</hi> What ſhall we then ſay to this interrogation, as it is made by <hi>Tremelius</hi> and <hi>Iunius? Shall a Trumpet be blowne in a Citie, and ſhall not the people tremblingly with feare run together?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The interrogation thus framed, for the ſubſtance of it, well agreeth with our new tranſlation; <hi>Shall a Trumpet be blowne in a City, and the people not be afraid?</hi> and therefore we may alike reſolue for both.</p>
                  <p>Our reſolution may be thus: This <hi>Trumpet</hi> muſt be blowne, not in time of <hi>peace</hi> when all is quiet; but in time of <hi>warre,</hi>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:1736:391"/> when all is in combuſtion: and it muſt be blowne, not in the ſtreets of the citie, but from the watch-tower: and it muſt be blowne not at an <hi>ordinary</hi> time, but when men leaſt thinke of it, to giue warning of the ſudden approach of the enemie vnto the citie. To this vnderſtanding we are directed by <hi>Ionathan,</hi> the <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſt,</hi> who addes vnto my text <hi>non ſuo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore,</hi> to giue the meaning of it: Shall a <hi>Trumpet</hi> be blowne in a citie, <hi>non ſuo tempore,</hi> out of its <hi>ordinary</hi> time, and ſhall not the people be afraid?</p>
                  <p>So, our Prophet here ſpeaketh <hi>de clangore buccinae extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinario,</hi> of an <hi>extraordinary</hi> blowing of the <hi>Trumpet;</hi> of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blowne <hi>alieno tempore,</hi> at a ſtrange time. Such a blowing of the <hi>trumpet,</hi> at ſuch a time, was euer a ſure token, <hi>aduentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis hoſtis,</hi> that the enemie was not farre of: <hi>Vnde pauor &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Druſius;</hi> whence feare and trembling were vpon the people.</p>
                  <p>Now to the interrogation, <hi>Shall a trumpet be blowne in a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the people not be afraid;</hi> or, <hi>ſhall they not tremblingly runne together?</hi> Our anſwer is negatiue; <hi>No.</hi> It cannot be, that in time of warre a <hi>trumpet</hi> ſhall be blowne in a citie at an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, an vnuſuall and a ſtrange houre, but the people will be <hi>afraid,</hi> and will <hi>tremblingly run together.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto hath the reading beene cleared, and the <hi>interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> anſwered: and now let vs ſee whereto this ſixth ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude taken from warriours is appliable. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it, as he doth the former. He applies it to ſuch as liue in <hi>diſcord</hi> and <hi>variance.</hi> He makes it to be their puniſhment; <hi>Vt in ciuitate Domini conſtituti, tubae ſonitu terreantur:</hi> that being placed in the <hi>city</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> they be terrified with the ſound of the <hi>trumpet.</hi> By this <hi>city</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> he meaneth the <hi>holy Catholike Church,</hi> and by this <hi>trumpet,</hi> the <hi>word of God</hi> ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the <hi>Church.</hi> For thus he addeth, Whatſoeuer is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in holy Scriptures, it is <hi>tuba comminans,</hi> a threatning <hi>trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,</hi> that with a mighty voice penetrateth the eares of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers. If we be righteous, this <hi>Trumpet</hi> of Chriſt calleth vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bleſſedneſſe; but if wicked, vnto torments. With the ſound of this <hi>trumpet</hi> ſhall they be terrified that liue in <hi>diſcord,</hi> and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1736:392"/> 
                     <hi>variance.</hi> Of the fouleneſſe and leproſie of which <hi>ſin,</hi> I ſpake at large in my laſt Sermon out of this place. Now therefore I leaue it, and proceed to ſome other application of this <hi>ſixth ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Cyril</hi> applies it to the Prophets of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and his Miniſters, thus: If a <hi>trumpet</hi> be blowne in a citie, to giue war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the approach of the enemy, who is there ſo without all ſenſe of griefe, as not to conceiue exceeding <hi>feare</hi> of future euils? But you, you the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> are ſo void of all ſenſe and feeling, that though my <hi>trumpets</hi> ceaſe not continually to ſound aloud in your eares, and to fore-warne you of euils, that ſhall <hi>come to paſſe,</hi> you receiue <hi>no profit thereby.</hi> Though you vnderſtand by the ſound of my <hi>trumpets,</hi> that your cities which are now inhabited,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezech.</hi> 12.20.</note> ſhall be <hi>laid waſte,</hi> and your Land <hi>ſhall be deſolate;</hi> yet you take courage to your ſelues againſt ſuch terrours,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Amos</hi> 6.3.</note> you put <hi>far away from you the euill day,</hi> you ſay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your ſelues,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezech.</hi> 12.27.</note> 
                     <hi>the viſion which</hi> this man ſeeth, <hi>is for many daies to come,</hi> and <hi>he propheſieth of the times that are far off.</hi> To this purpoſe Saint <hi>Cyril.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With him agree three great <hi>Rabbins, R. Dauid, R. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, R. Selomo.</hi> They make the <hi>Lord</hi> here to ſpeake after this manner: If a <hi>trumpet</hi> be blowne in a <hi>citie</hi> at an vnſeaſonable houre to giue warning that the enemie is comming, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will <hi>exceedingly tremble</hi> and <hi>be afraid.</hi> Why then, <hi>are not you afraid?</hi> why <hi>tremble yee not at the voices of my Prophets?</hi> My <hi>Prophets</hi> are my <hi>trumpeters:</hi> by them I giue you warning of the euils that hang ouer your heads, and will ere long fall vpon you. Why are you <hi>not afraid?</hi> why <hi>tremble you not?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this application of this ſixth ſimilitude, our new Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors for the moſt part haue ſubſcribed. They vnderſtand by this <hi>Citie</hi> the <hi>Church of God,</hi> by the <hi>Trumpet</hi> the <hi>Word of God,</hi> by the <hi>people</hi> the <hi>bearers of the Word:</hi> and ſo, thus ſtands the application: When a <hi>trumpet</hi> giueth a ſudden ſigne by the ſound of it out of a watch-tower, all the people <hi>harken,</hi> and <hi>are troubled,</hi> and <hi>prepare themſelues</hi> this way or that way, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the <hi>trumpet</hi> giueth the token: So at the <hi>voice of God</hi> founding by his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> we ought to <hi>giue eare</hi> and <hi>be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,</hi>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:1736:392"/> and be <hi>moued</hi> at the noiſe of it, and as he giueth warning, <hi>prepare our ſelues</hi> and looke about vs while it is time, leſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward it be too late.</p>
                  <p>Now the leſſon which we are to take from hence is this,
<q>The word of <hi>God</hi> vttered by his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> deſerueth more reuerence, feare, and trembling, then doth a trumpet ſounding an alarme from a watch-tower.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the <hi>word of God</hi> is a <hi>trumpet</hi> too, and a <hi>trumpet</hi> of a farre ſhriller ſound. The blowers of this <hi>trumpet</hi> are the Miniſters of the <hi>Word,</hi> who in this regard are called ſometimes <hi>Tuba Dei,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Speculatores.</hi> They are Gods <hi>trumpet,</hi> and they are <hi>watch-men.</hi> They are <hi>Tuba Dei,</hi> Gods <hi>trumpet:</hi> and hereby are they put in minde of their dutie; euen to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce perpetuall <hi>warre</hi> againſt the wicked; and to excite men, euen to fight againſt the <hi>Deuill,</hi> and to bid defiance vnto <hi>ſinne.</hi> And they are <hi>Speculatores,</hi> they are <hi>Watch-men,</hi> placed by God in his holy Citie, <hi>the Church, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>elut in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culâ,</hi> as in a Watch-tower, to watch for the ſafetie of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to blow the <hi>trumpet</hi> vnto them, when any danger is at hand.</p>
                  <p>Both appellations are met together in <hi>Ierem.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tui ſuper vos ſpeculatores; audite vocem tubae:</hi> I haue ſet ouer you <hi>watch-men:</hi> hearken to the ſound of the <hi>trumpet.</hi> Biſhops, Paſtors, Miniſters; they are theſe <hi>watch-men:</hi> and wee are to hearken to the ſound of their <hi>trumpets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their <hi>trumpets?</hi> True. For Miniſters haue <hi>trumpets.</hi> Their <hi>trumpets</hi> are two. One is <hi>Territoria,</hi> the other is <hi>Conſolato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi> One is a <hi>terrifying</hi> trumpet; the other trumpet is <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the former God ſpeaketh by his Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> chap. 58.1. <hi>Crie aloud, ſpare not, lift vp thy voice like a</hi> trumpet, <hi>and ſhew my people their tranſgreſſion, and the houſe of Iacob their ſinnes.</hi> So doth hee by <hi>Zephania,</hi> chap. 1.16. <hi>A day of the</hi> Trumpet <hi>and alarme againſt the fenced cities, and againſt the high towers: And I will bring diſtreſſe vpon men,</hi> that they ſhall <hi>walke like blinde men, becauſe they haue ſinned againſt the</hi> Lord. This <hi>trumpet</hi> you may call <hi>tubam legis,</hi> the trumpet
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1736:393"/> of the Law: becauſe by if the Miniſter denounceth the curſes of the Law, the wrath of God, miſery, and calamitie to euery vnrepentant ſinner.</p>
                  <p>Of the other <hi>trumpet</hi> of the miniſtery, we may vnderſtand that, <hi>Eſay</hi> 27.13. <hi>The great</hi> Trumpet <hi>ſhall be blowne, and they ſhall come, which were readie to periſh in the Land of</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>and the out-caſts in the Land of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>and ſhall worſhip the</hi> Lord <hi>in the holy Mount at Ieruſalem.</hi> This <hi>trumpet</hi> you may call <hi>tubam Euangelij,</hi> the trumpet of the Goſpell: becauſe by it the <hi>Miniſter</hi> pronounceth the bleſſings of the Goſpell; the loue of God, a quiet conſcience, and true felicity to euery true beleeuer.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two <hi>trumpets, terrifying</hi> and <hi>comforting,</hi> that of the <hi>Law,</hi> this of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> are ſtill of vſe in the Church of Chriſt, the <hi>Miniſter</hi> ſounding ſometimes <hi>woe,</hi> ſometimes <hi>weale,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as our ſinnes ſhall giue him cauſe.</p>
                  <p>But why is it, that the miniſtery of the Word, and the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching thereof, is compared to a trumpet? <hi>Hector Pintus</hi> in his <hi>Comment</hi> vpon the eight and fiftieth of <hi>Eſay</hi> giueth hereof two reaſons. One is, becauſe, as the <hi>materiall trumpet</hi> calleth and encourageth vnto warre; ſo this <hi>ſpirituall trumpet,</hi> the preaching of the Word, calleth and encourageth vs to fight valiantly againſt the world, the fleſh and the Deuill. The other is, becauſe as the <hi>materiall trumpet</hi> is blowne at ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to betoken ioy: ſo this <hi>ſpirituall trumpet,</hi> the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, ſhould ſtirre vs vp <hi>ad laborem in praeſenti, &amp; ad gaudium in futuro:</hi> to labour in this life, and to ioy in that to come. For as he addeth, <hi>hic eſt locus vincendi, ibi triumphan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di: hic breuis laboris, illic ſempiterna quietis: hic poenae tranſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untis, ibi gloriae permanentis.</hi> Here is the place for <hi>ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi> there for the <hi>triumph:</hi> here of ſome <hi>little labour,</hi> there of eternall quiet: here of paine that paſſeth away, there of glory that endureth.</p>
                  <p>The compariſon ſtanding thus betweene the preaching of the Word, and a trumpet, warranteth the truth of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine propounded; which was,
<q>The word of <hi>God</hi> vttered by his Miniſters deſerueth more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1736:393"/> 
                        <hi>feare,</hi> and trembling, then doth a <hi>trumpet</hi> ſounding an <hi>alarme</hi> from a watch-tower.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This repreſentation of the <hi>word of God</hi> by a <hi>trumpet</hi> ſhould euer ſound, and as it were, goe before vs, in all our actions, in warre, in peace, in all meetings and ioyfull feaſts, that all our doings may be acceptable to the Lord our God.</p>
                  <p>The doctrine now deliuered, ſtanding vpon the compariſon that is betweene the <hi>preaching of the Word</hi> and <hi>a trumpet,</hi> may in termes abſolute be thus; <hi>The preaching of the word of</hi> God <hi>is to be harkened vnto with all reuerence.</hi> It is the point I hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in my firſt Sermon vpon this third Chapter of <hi>Amos.</hi> My <hi>Theſis</hi> then was, <hi>The word of</hi> God <hi>is diligently to be harkened vnto.</hi> What proofes and reaſons out of Scripture I then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for the confirmation of that truth, and what vſe was made thereof, I now ſtand not to repeat. Nor need I ſo to doe. The <hi>holy Scripture</hi> being as the Ocean of waters which can neuer bee exhauſted, yeeldeth vs great varietie of matter, though we ſpeake againe and againe to the ſame point. I proceed then with my <hi>Theſis,</hi> as it is giuen in termes abſolute,
<q>The preaching of the word of <hi>God</hi> is to be harkened vnto with all reuerence.</q>

                  <p>There is yet a further <hi>danger</hi> of our <hi>negligent hearing,</hi> and that is the loſſe of the word of God from among vs. <hi>Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent hearing</hi> deſerues no leſſe: for it is a rebellion againſt God, and God will tye the tongues of his ſeruants, that they ſhall not preach his Word to ſuch.

                  <p>My firſt diſtinction is; Things may bee termed <hi>euill</hi> two manner of waies: ſome are euill <hi>indeed,</hi> and of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: in this ranke we muſt place our ſins: ſome are <hi>euill</hi> not <hi>indeed,</hi> and in their <hi>owne nature,</hi> but in regard of our ſenſe, apprehenſion and eſtimation; and in this ranke we muſt place <hi>whatſoeuer affliction</hi> God layeth vpon vs in this life for our ſinnes. This diſtinction is Saint <hi>Baſils,</hi> in his Homily, wherein he proueth, that <hi>God is not the Author of euils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next diſtinction is out of Saint <hi>Auguſtine, chap.</hi> 26. againſt <hi>Adimantus</hi> the <hi>Manichee:</hi> There are two ſorts of <hi>euils;</hi> there is <hi>malum, quod facit homo,</hi> and there is <hi>malum, quod patitur.</hi> There is an <hi>euill,</hi> which the wicked man <hi>doth;</hi> and there is an <hi>euill,</hi> which he <hi>ſuffereth.</hi> That is <hi>ſinne;</hi> this, the <hi>puniſhment of ſinne.</hi> In that, the wicked are <hi>Agents;</hi> in this, they are <hi>Patients:</hi> that, is done <hi>by them;</hi> this, is done <hi>vpon them.</hi> They offend Gods Iuſtice, and God in his Iuſtice offends them:</p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:1736:401"/>
                  <p>This is otherwiſe deliuered by the ſame Father, <hi>De fide ad Petrum, cap.</hi> 21. <hi>Geminum eſſe conſtat naturae rationalis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum: vnum, quo voluntariè ipſa deficit à ſummo Bono, creatore ſuo: Alterum quo iuuita punietur ignis aeterni ſupplicio; illud paſſura iuſtè, quia hoc admiſit iniuſtè.</hi> It is, ſaith he, manifeſt, that there is a two-fold <hi>euill</hi> of the reaſonable nature, that is, of man. One, whereby man <hi>voluntarily forſaketh</hi> the chiefeſt good, God, his Creator: the other, whereby he ſhall <hi>againſt his will be puniſhed</hi> in the flames of euerlaſting fire. So ſhall he <hi>iuſtly</hi> ſuffer, that <hi>vniuſtly</hi> offended.</p>
                  <p>In his firſt Diſputation againſt <hi>Fortunatus</hi> the <hi>Manichee,</hi> he ſpeaketh yet more plainly. Sith, ſaith he, there are two kinds of euill <hi>Peccatum, &amp; poena peccati;</hi> Sinne, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſinne; the one, namely <hi>ſinne,</hi> pertaines not vnto God: the other, <hi>the puniſhment of ſinne</hi> belongs vnto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tertullian lib.</hi> 2. <hi>contra Marcionem, cap.</hi> 14. more than a hundred yeeres before Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> time, deliuers this diſtinction with much perſpicuity. There is <hi>malum delicti,</hi> and <hi>malum ſupplicij:</hi> or, there is <hi>malum culpae</hi> and <hi>malum poenae.</hi> There is an euill <hi>of ſinne,</hi> and an euill <hi>of puniſhment:</hi> and of each part he nominateth the Author; <hi>Malorum quidem pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cati &amp; culpae, Diabolum; malorum verò ſupplicij &amp; poenae De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um creatorem:</hi> Of the euils of ſinne or default the Deuill is the Author: but of the euills of paine and puniſhment, hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the hand of <hi>God,</hi> the Creator.</p>
                  <p>This ſecond diſtinction of euills, <hi>Rupertus</hi> well expreſſeth in other termes: There is <hi>malum, quod eſt iniquitas,</hi> and there is <hi>malum, quod eſt Afflictio propter iniquitatem:</hi> There is an euill of <hi>Iniquity,</hi> and an euill of <hi>Affliction.</hi> So he agreeth with the ancient Fathers.</p>
                  <p>My third diſtinction is of the euills of puniſhment. Of theſe there are two ſorts. Some are <hi>onely</hi> the puniſhments of ſinne, either <hi>eternall</hi> in Hell, or <hi>temporall</hi> in this world: and ſome are <hi>ſo</hi> the puniſhments of ſinne, that they are <hi>alſo</hi> ſinnes and cauſes of ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>My fourth diſtinction is, <hi>De malo culpae:</hi> it concernes the euill of ſinne. The <hi>euill of ſinne</hi> may bee conſidered three
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1736:402"/> manner of waies. Firſt, as it is a <hi>ſinne</hi> repugnant to the Law of God; and ſo onely is it <hi>malum culpae,</hi> the euill of ſinne. Secondly, as it is a <hi>puniſhment</hi> of ſome precedent ſinne, for God vſeth to <hi>puniſh ſinne</hi> with <hi>ſinne.</hi>
                  </p>

Thirdly, as it is a <hi>cauſe</hi> of ſome ſubſequent <hi>ſinne:</hi> ſuch as was <hi>excoecatio in Iudaeis,</hi> whereof we reade, <hi>Eſay</hi> 6.10. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coeca cor populi huius,</hi> Make thou the heart of this people <hi>blind,</hi> or <hi>make</hi> it <hi>fat;</hi> make their eares <hi>heauy,</hi> and <hi>ſhut</hi> their eyes, leſt they ſee <hi>with their eyes,</hi> and heare <hi>with their eares,</hi> and vnderſtand <hi>with their hearts,</hi> and <hi>conuert,</hi> and be <hi>healed.</hi> This ſame <hi>excoecation</hi> or <hi>blindneſſe</hi> in the <hi>Iewes,</hi> was the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of a <hi>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus haue you my diſtinctions. I promiſed to draw from them ſome concluſions.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is: <hi>God is the Author of euery euill of puniſhment.</hi>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:1736:402"/> Euery ſuch <hi>euill</hi> God willeth. The <hi>will</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is the primarie efficient cauſe thereof. It may thus be proued. Euery <hi>good thing</hi> is of God. Now euery <hi>euill of puniſhment,</hi> euery pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, is a <hi>good thing;</hi> for it is a worke of <hi>iuſtice,</hi> by which ſinnes are puniſhed, and ſo a <hi>iuſt worke;</hi> and therefore <hi>euery puniſhment is of God,</hi> and God <hi>willeth it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond concluſion: <hi>The euill of ſinne, as it is a</hi> puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>of ſome former ſinne, God willeth and inflicteth.</hi> This is that ſame receiued and much vſed axiome in Diuinty; <hi>God puniſheth ſinnes with ſinnes.</hi> In ſo doing hee doth no more, then what becommeth a iuſt Iudge to doe. Hereof Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ne, Contra aduerſarium legis &amp; Prophetarum lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. thus ſpeaketh: It is a fearefull iudgement, when God takes courſe, <hi>Vt crimina criminibus vindicantur, &amp; ſupplicia peccantium non ſunt tormenta, ſed incrementa vitiorum.</hi> Feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is the iudgement, when God taketh courſe, that <hi>ſinnes</hi> be reuenged with <hi>ſinnes,</hi> and the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of euill doers bee no <hi>torment</hi> to them, but <hi>additions</hi> to their euill doings. O, this is a fearefull iudgement, which Saint <hi>Gregory, Moral. lib.</hi> 25. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. expreſſeth after this manner: <hi>Hoc quippe agitur, vt culpae culpis feriantur, quatenus ſuplicia fiant peccantium ipſa incrementa vitiorum:</hi> It is the moſt admirable iudgement of God, and moſt dreadfull of all other, when he taketh courſe that <hi>ſinne</hi> be ſtricken <hi>with ſinne,</hi> ſo as that the <hi>increaſe of ſinne</hi> is the <hi>puniſhment of</hi> the ſinner: it being ordered by <hi>diſpoſition aboue,</hi> but yet by reaſon of the <hi>confuſion</hi> of iniquity <hi>beneath,</hi> both that the former ſinne is the <hi>cauſe</hi> of the latter, and the latter is the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of the former. This of all the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God is the <hi>moſt admirable,</hi> the moſt dreadfull.</p>
                  <p>My third concluſion, <hi>The euill of ſinne as it is an Action God willeth; he worketh it, he doth it.</hi> For whatſoeuer God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly willeth, the ſame he worketh, he doth it, either <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly</hi> by himſelfe; or <hi>Sua virtute,</hi> through his power, by others. Now if <hi>Quaecunque voluit, fecit,</hi> as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.3. if God hath done whatſoeuer he hath willed, then ſurely, <hi>Quaecunque fecit, vult,</hi> whatſoeuer he <hi>doth,</hi> that hee <hi>willeth.</hi> And the truth is, not in Philoſophy onely, alſo in the holy
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1736:403"/> Scriptures, that God is the primary cauſe of all <hi>actions,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they are, as farre forth as they are <hi>actions.</hi> This is that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.6. <hi>God worketh all in all.</hi> For though he ſpeaketh concerning the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, yet is his propoſition generall, <hi>God worketh all in all:</hi> like to that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. God is he, <hi>of whom are all things, through whom are all things, and to whom are all things. All things?</hi> He meaneth not onely all <hi>ſubſtances,</hi> but alſo all the <hi>actions</hi> of all <hi>things.</hi> For as all <hi>actions</hi> are gouerned by him, and doe tend vnto him; ſo alſo are they all of him, as of the firſt mouer; according to that, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.28. <hi>In him we liue, and moue, and haue our being.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth Concluſion: <hi>The euill of ſinne, as it is ſinne, God properly willeth not, neither indeed can he will it.</hi> For <hi>Sinne,</hi> as it is <hi>ſinne,</hi> is that ſame <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> whereof I ſpake in my fifth diſtinction: it is the <hi>crookedneſſe,</hi> the <hi>obliquity,</hi> the <hi>naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of an <hi>action;</hi> it is the <hi>ſwaruing</hi> of an <hi>action</hi> from the line of the will of God reuealed in his holy Word: whereof to make <hi>God</hi> a doer, or author, is execrable and blaſphemous impiety. <hi>Non Deus volens iniquitatem tu es, Pſal.</hi> 5.4. is a deſcription of God according to his proper nature; God is not <hi>a God that willeth iniquity.</hi> It is proper vnto him <hi>Nolle inquitatem,</hi> Not to will iniquity. <hi>Habbakkuk</hi> auoucheth it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.13. <hi>O Lord my God mine holy one, thou art of purer eyes than to behold</hi> euill, <hi>and canſt not looke on</hi> iniquity; <hi>Mundi ſunt oculi tui,</hi> thine eyes are pure, free from all ſpot and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe; that thou canſt not behold <hi>euill,</hi> to approue it; nor canſt looke on <hi>iniquity,</hi> to allow it. So true is my fourth Concluſion: <hi>The euill of ſinne, as it is ſinne, God properly wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not, neither indeed can he will it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now out of theſe concluſions, and the fore-alleaged di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, I frame the reſolution to the doubt propounded. The doubt was, <hi>How is it that God</hi> abſolutely good, <hi>good in Se,</hi> and <hi>good Extra ſe:</hi> good in himſelfe, and good to all his creatures, is here in my Text ſaid <hi>to doe euill?</hi> The reſolution is: The <hi>euill</hi> in my Text is not <hi>malum culpae, delicti aut ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitatis;</hi> it is not the euill of default, the euill of ſinne, or the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1736:403"/> euill of iniquity: but it is <hi>malum poenae ſupplicij ſine afflictionis:</hi> It is the euill of paine, the euill of puniſhment, the euill of affliction. Not of <hi>that,</hi> but of <hi>this,</hi> is my Text to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. <hi>Shall there be euill in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> No there ſhall be no <hi>euill</hi> in a City; no euill of <hi>paine, puniſhment,</hi> or <hi>affliction,</hi> but the Lord <hi>hath done it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus you are to vnderſtand that <hi>Eſay</hi> 45.7. <hi>I, the Lord, create euill.</hi> And that, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 18.11. <hi>I, the Lord, frame euill againſt you.</hi> I create <hi>euill;</hi> I frame <hi>euill.</hi> By <hi>euill</hi> in both places, <hi>Tertullian</hi> againſt <hi>Marcion, lib.</hi> 2, <hi>cap.</hi> 24. vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth <hi>mala non peccatoria, ſed vlt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>euill</hi> of reuengement! The <hi>euill</hi> of paine, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or affliction! But why <hi>euill?</hi> Surely euery <hi>reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> euery <hi>paine,</hi> euery <hi>puniſhment,</hi> euery <hi>affliction</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falleth vs in this life, is <hi>good.</hi> It is <hi>good.</hi> Firſt, becauſe it is <hi>laid vpon vs by God,</hi> who is of himſelfe, and abſolutely good. Secondly, becauſe <hi>it is iuſt,</hi> and whatſoeuer is iuſt muſt needs be good. Thirdly, becauſe <hi>it hath a good end;</hi> the glory of God and the ſaluation of the elect. For theſe reaſons it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, but that euery reuengement, paine, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and affliction is <hi>good.</hi> Why then is it in my Text, and elſewhere called <hi>euill?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer according to my ſecond diſtinction. Reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, paines, puniſhments, and afflictions are called <hi>euils,</hi> not becauſe they are <hi>euills indeed</hi> and of their owne nature, but only in regard of <hi>our ſenſe,</hi> eſtimation and apprehenſion. The very torments of Hell, eternall fire, and outer darkneſſe are not indeed and of their nature euill: <hi>Mala ſunt, his, qui incidunt in ea,</hi> ſaith <hi>Irenaeus aduerſus haereſes, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 77. they are <hi>euill</hi> to ſuch as fall into them; but <hi>Bona, ex juſtitia Dei,</hi> good they are, as they are from Gods iuſtice.</p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:1736:404"/>
                  <p>What <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaith concerning <hi>Hell-torments,</hi> the ſame is true of the <hi>aduerſities,</hi> the <hi>croſſes,</hi> the <hi>ſcourges,</hi> the <hi>afflictions</hi> that befall men in this life. <hi>Euils</hi> they are called, and God is ſaid to doe them. But how <hi>euils?</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Com. in Ierem.</hi> will tell vs how: they are called euills, <hi>non quòd per ſe mala ſint,</hi> not becauſe they are of themſelues <hi>euill, ſed quod patientibus mala eſſe videantur,</hi> but becauſe they ſeeme euill to vs who ſuffer them.</p>

Whatſoeuer is any way grieuous or offenſiue to our humane nature I call <hi>affliction.</hi> The temptations of the fleſh, the world, and the Deuill; the diſeaſes of the body; a froward husband or wife; rebellious children; vnthankfull friends; loſſe of goods; reproches, ſlanders, warre, peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, famine, impriſonment, death; euery <hi>croſſe</hi> and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, bodily and ghoſtly, proper to our ſelues, or pertaining to our kindred, priuate or publike, ſecret or manifeſt, either by our owne deſerts gotten, or otherwiſe impoſed vpon vs, I call <hi>afflictions.</hi> To be ſhort, the miſeries, the calamities, the vexations, the moleſtations of this life, from the leaſt to the greateſt, from the paine of the little finger to the very pangs of death, I call <hi>afflictions.</hi> Of euery ſuch <hi>affliction,</hi> whatſoeuer it betideth any one in this life, God is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Sith there is no <hi>affliction,</hi> that betideth <hi>any one</hi> any where in this world, but its <hi>from the Lord;</hi> and as the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>chap.</hi> 12.8. <hi>He is a</hi> baſtard <hi>and not a</hi> ſonne, <hi>that is not partaker of afflictions;</hi> let vs, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> aduiſeth, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.2. account it <hi>exceeding ioy,</hi> when wee are <hi>afflicted.</hi>

The <hi>decree</hi> and <hi>purpoſe of God</hi> to puniſh a people for ſinne is his <hi>ſecret;</hi> and this he euermore <hi>reuealeth.</hi> Yet not this alone. For of the <hi>ſecrets</hi> which God <hi>reuealeth</hi> there are three kinds.</p>
                  <p>One is of things <hi>ſupernaturall,</hi> ſuch as are the <hi>myſteries</hi> of Religion, the <hi>incarnation</hi> of the Sonne of God, the <hi>reſurrection</hi> of the dead, and the <hi>life</hi> to come. Theſe are <hi>ſecrets,</hi> to the knowledge of which a man cannot attaine, vnleſſe it be <hi>reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> vnto him from God.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is of thoſe things, which are called <hi>arcana cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> the ſecrets of the heart, ſuch as are the proper actions of the <hi>will</hi> and vnderſtanding: <hi>Secrets</hi> they are; and ſaue to the

                     <hi>ſpirit of man,</hi> which is in man, are knowne to none, but <hi>God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.24.</note> who is, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, and knoweth euery corner and creuiſe of the heart.</p>
                  <p>The third is of thoſe things, which the <hi>Schooles</hi> doe call <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura contingentia,</hi> ſuch things as <hi>are</hi> not, nor euer <hi>haue</hi> beene, but <hi>may</hi> hereafter be. And theſe are <hi>ſecrets, ſecrets</hi> indeed, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſt vnto <hi>him,</hi> by whom all things, paſt, preſent, and to come, are acted and gouerned.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe three kindes of <hi>ſecrets,</hi> the laſt is that whereof my text ſpeaketh, the <hi>ſecret</hi> of things to come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Surely the Lord God will doe nothing, but he reuealeth his</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret <hi>to his ſeruants the Prophets.</hi> Hee reuealeth his <hi>ſecret</hi>] hee openeth it, he telleth it before hand, he makes it knowne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it come to paſſe. The leſſon to be taken from hence is,
<q>God is the only reuealer of ſecrets.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He only <hi>reuealeth</hi> things to come. This truth is auouched by the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> in his <hi>ſecond Chapter</hi> the 22. verſe: his aſſertion is: <hi>God is He, that reuealeth the deepe and ſecret things.</hi> At the 28. verſe he telleth <hi>King Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> Though the <hi>wiſe-men,</hi> the <hi>Aſtrologians,</hi> the <hi>Magicians,</hi> the <hi>Sooth-ſayers,</hi> cannot ſhew vnto the <hi>King</hi> the <hi>ſecret</hi> which he demandeth, yet there is <hi>a God in Heauen that reuealeth ſecrets, and maketh knowne to the King what ſhall be in the latter dayes.</hi> He ſaith it againe, verſ. 29. <hi>He that reuealeth ſecrets maketh knowne vnto thee, O King, what ſhall come to paſſe.</hi> Once more, verſ. 45. <hi>The great God</hi> hath make knowne to the King, <hi>what ſhall come to paſſe hereafter.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> acknowledgeth as much; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſaith, verſ. 47. <hi>Of a truth, Daniel, your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of Kings, and a reuealer of ſecrets.</hi> It is true: <hi>God is the only reuealer of ſecrets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it true? What ſhall we then ſay to ſundry <hi>predictions</hi> in <hi>Gentiliſme?</hi> What to thoſe <hi>dreames</hi> which the Heathen often had? What to their <hi>Oracles?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hier. Comment. in Eſai. <hi>41.</hi>
                     </note> What to <hi>Apollo Delphicus</hi> and <hi>Loxias,</hi> and <hi>Delius,</hi> and <hi>Clarius?</hi> What to other their <hi>Idols,</hi> which made faire ſhew, as if they had the knowledge of <hi>things to come,</hi> and could <hi>reueale ſecrets?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our anſwer is; they were meere ſhewes; no ſubſtance of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1736:411"/> truth was in them. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> in his <hi>twelfth booke of his Comments vpon Eſay at the</hi> 41. <hi>Chapter</hi> thus reaſoneth againſt them: <hi>If they could fore-tell things to come,</hi> why foretold they <hi>nothing of Chriſt?</hi> Why <hi>nothing of the twelue Apoſtles?</hi> Why <hi>nothing of the ruine,</hi> and abolition of <hi>their owne Temples?</hi> If they could not <hi>foretell</hi> their <hi>owne deſtruction,</hi> how could they <hi>fore-tell</hi> either <hi>good</hi> or <hi>euill,</hi> that ſhould betide others?</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay; many things were <hi>fore-told</hi> by the <hi>oracles</hi> of old. Know then, that from thoſe <hi>oracles</hi> the <hi>Deuill,</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lyes, that he might not be reproued of falſhood, did euermore giue his anſwers <hi>doubtfully,</hi> that you might expound them <hi>both wayes,</hi> either for <hi>good</hi> or <hi>euill.</hi> Such was his anſwer giuen to <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of the <hi>Epirotes,</hi> when hee tooke part with the <hi>Tarentines</hi> againſt the <hi>Romans.</hi>

                  <p>The Heathen were not much troubled with the firſt ſort, with <hi>diuine dreames:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dreames</hi> of the ſecond ſort are <hi>Naturall;</hi> and ſuch, no doubt, the <hi>Heathen</hi> in their ſleepe had, as wee in ours haue. But in theſe there is no <hi>diuination;</hi> no fore-knowing of things to come.</p>
                  <p>The third ſort is of <hi>dreames diabolicall,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Such <hi>dreames,</hi> as theſe, are well cenſured by <hi>Siracides</hi> in the 34. of his <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> verſ. 5. <hi>Diuinations, and ſooth-ſayi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus finding no ſound ability either in the <hi>dreames</hi> of the Heathen, or in their <hi>Oracles,</hi> to reueale ſecrets, or foretell things to come: we muſt euer acknowledge it for a truth irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable, and not to be gain-ſaid, that <hi>God is the only reuealer of ſecrets:</hi> that <hi>he only</hi> foretelleth things to come.</p>

                  <q>God neuer bringeth any grieuous iudgement vpon any people or nation, nor vpon any priuate perſon, but he doth alwaies firſt fore-warne the ſame and foretelleth <hi>it.</hi>

                  <p>God alwayes <hi>teacheth</hi> before hee <hi>puniſheth:</hi> hee <hi>warneth</hi> before hee <hi>ſtriketh.</hi> When hee was reſolued to waſh the World with a Deluge of waters for the ſinne thereof, hee fore-told it vnto <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 6.13. Though the crie of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> were great, and their ſinne very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, yet would not God deſtroy them, till he had made knowne his purpoſe vnto <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18.17. and to <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 19.13.

                  <p>Will hee <hi>doe nothing,</hi> but hee <hi>reuealeth it?</hi> Wee may not ſo take it, that God reuealeth to his Prophets, <hi>all things</hi> which he hath a purpoſe to doe, <hi>all things ſimply,</hi> all his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets: But with a certaine limitation, that hee reuealeth <hi>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia vtilia nobis,</hi> as <hi>Hugo de S. Charo</hi> out of the <hi>Gloſſe</hi> hath obſerued; that hee reuealeth all things <hi>profitable</hi> for vs: or, that hee reuealeth, <hi>Omnia, quae bonum communitatis concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunt,</hi> as <hi>Carthuſian</hi> ſpeaketh, that hee reuealeth <hi>all things,</hi> which concerne the common good. <hi>All things</hi> which either concerne the common good, or are profitable vnto vs, ſuch as are the <hi>iudgements of God</hi> to be laid vpon a multitude or a priuate perſon, <hi>God reuealeth.</hi> This is the ſubſtance of the doctrine euen now deliuered.</p>
                  <q>God neuer bringeth any grieuous iudgement vpon any people or Nation, or vpon any priuate perſon, but he doth alwaies firſt fore-warne the ſame, and foretelleth <hi>it.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>The reaſons hereof are two. One is in regard of the godly: the other in regard of the wicked.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is in regard of the godly. God is vnwilling at any time to take them at vnawares. He loueth them, and would not haue <hi>any of them to periſh,</hi> but would haue <hi>them all come to repentance,</hi> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> witneſſeth, 2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3.9. God would haue <hi>them all</hi> come to repentance, that ſo they might preuent his iudgements. And therefore he neuer <hi>ſtriketh,</hi> but firſt he <hi>warneth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other reaſon is in regard of the <hi>wicked:</hi> namely that the <hi>wicked</hi> might be <hi>without excuſe,</hi> their mouthes might be ſtopped, and the iuſtice of God cleared, they hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to anſwer for themſelues, or to accuſe God of any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt dealing. <hi>If I had not come,</hi> ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.22. <hi>If I had not come, and ſpoken to them, they had not had ſinne;</hi> but <hi>now they haue no cloake, nor excuſe, for their ſinne.</hi> Wherefore let theſe men, <hi>wicked men,</hi> learne, as oft as the rod of God lieth heauie vpon them, to <hi>accuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues;</hi> becauſe when God <hi>gaue them warning,</hi> they would not be warned: when God would haue <hi>healed them,</hi> they would not be healed.</p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:1736:413"/>
                  <p>You haue the reaſons; The vſes follow. I can but point at them: the time will not ſuffer any enlargement. Is it ſo, beloued? Doth God neuer bring any grieuous iudgement vpon any people or Nation, or any priuate perſon, but he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <hi>first fore-warneth the ſame and fore-telleth it?</hi> Here then acknowledge we <hi>Gods great mercie,</hi> and his <hi>wonderfull patience.</hi> Thus <hi>God</hi> needeth not to deale with vs. For vpon our owne perill we are bound to take heed of his iudgements before they come. Yet ſo <hi>good</hi> is our <hi>God,</hi> ſo <hi>louing,</hi> ſo <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull,</hi> ſo <hi>patient,</hi> that he is deſirous wee ſhould <hi>preuent</hi> his iudgements before they fall, by ſending <hi>our prayers</hi> vnto him as Embaſſadours, to treat of conditions of <hi>Peace</hi> with him. A ſubtill enemie would ſteale vpon vs at vnawares, and take vs at the aduantage: but <hi>God,</hi> our <hi>good God</hi> euer <hi>fore-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth</hi> before hee <hi>ſtriketh.</hi> Hee doth ſo, ſaith <hi>Carthuſian, Vt emendemur &amp; ab imminentibus eripiamur tormentis:</hi> hee euer <hi>fore-warneth</hi> vs, that our liues may bee <hi>amended,</hi> and wee deliuered <hi>from the torments</hi> that hang ouer vs readie to fall vpon vs.</p>
                  <p>Againe, doth God neuer bring any grieuous iudgement vpon any people or Nation, or any priuate perſon, but he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes firſt <hi>fore-warneth the ſame, and foretelleth it?</hi> Let vs then, whenſoeuer wee ſee any ouertaken with any grieuous iudgement, confeſſe with Saint <hi>Auguſtine de verâ &amp; falſâ poenitentiâ, cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Qui verus eſt in promittendo, verus etiam eſt in minando:</hi> that <hi>God</hi> is true, as in his <hi>promiſes,</hi> ſo alſo in his <hi>threatnings.</hi> If his deſire were not, that wee ſhould <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent</hi> his iudgements, doubtleſſe he would neuer giue vs <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of them. If hee had a will and purpoſe to <hi>deſtroy vs,</hi> he would neuer <hi>tell before-hand,</hi> how wee ſhould auoid his iudgements. Let no man ſay, that the <hi>ſilence of God,</hi> and the holding of his peace, is a cauſe of his <hi>ſecuritie.</hi> No, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo. <hi>God</hi> neuer commeth with any iudgement, but he alwayes ſendeth a <hi>warning peece</hi> before. He ſendeth vnto vs his ſeruants the <hi>Prophets. Prophets</hi> we haue among vs; and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> we haue among vs: and <hi>God</hi> giueth vs his <hi>Miniſters, Pastors,</hi> and <hi>Preachers,</hi> as it were to put life againe into the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:1736:414"/> dead <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> euen to open and declare vnto vs thoſe things which they deliuered. Wherefore, when we ſhall be admoniſhed by his <hi>Ministers,</hi> that ſuch and ſuch <hi>iudgements ſhall come;</hi> when they ſhall <hi>threaten plagues</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the generall directions, which they haue in the word of <hi>God,</hi> let vs not withſtand the <hi>Spirit</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in them.

                  <p>By <hi>himſelfe</hi> God ſpeaketh, when by the ſole force of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall inſpiration the <hi>heart</hi> is opened: or God ſpeaketh <hi>by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,</hi> when the <hi>heart</hi> is taught concerning the word of God, without words or ſyllables.

                  <p>From this <hi>inward ſpeaking</hi> of God by his <hi>holy Spirit</hi> in the <hi>hearts</hi> of men without either words or ſound, we may note thus much for our preſent comfort, that whenſoeuer <hi>wee</hi> are <hi>inwardly moued,</hi> and doe feele our <hi>hearts</hi> touched with an <hi>earneſt deſire,</hi> either to <hi>offer vp</hi> our priuate requeſts to God, or to <hi>come</hi> to the place of publike prayer, or to <hi>heare</hi> the preaching of the word, or to <hi>receiue</hi> the bleſſed Sacrament of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> or to <hi>doe</hi> any good worke, we may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that <hi>God</hi> by his <hi>holy Spirit, God</hi> by <hi>himſelfe</hi> ſpeaketh vnto vs.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 God ſpeaketh <hi>Rebus,</hi> by things; By <hi>things onely,</hi> as when no <hi>voice</hi> is heard, but ſome <hi>thing</hi> onely is obiected to the ſenſes.

                  <p>Is a <hi>neceſſity</hi> laid vpon vs? Thats not all. For a <hi>Woe</hi> is due vnto vs if we preach not. <hi>Vae mihi,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16. <hi>Woe is mee if I preach not the Goſpell.</hi> If I preach not the <hi>Goſpell!</hi> What then ſhall become of the <hi>Law?</hi> Wee muſt preach <hi>both,</hi> as the <hi>Goſpell</hi> ſo the <hi>Law.</hi> As wee are to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the <hi>tidings of ioy</hi> to thoſe that reioyce in our meſſage, ſo are wee to denounce the <hi>terrors of iudgement</hi> to thoſe that contemne it. As wee are to preach <hi>liberty to captiues,</hi> ſo are wee to threaten <hi>captiuity to libertines.</hi> As wee are to pipe to thoſe that will dance after vs, ſo are wee to ſound a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of warre to thoſe that will reſiſt vs. As we are to build <hi>an Arke</hi> for thoſe that will bee ſaued, ſo are we to powre out a <hi>floud of maledictions</hi> againſt thoſe that will bee dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Finally, as wee are to <hi>open the doores</hi> to thoſe that knocke and are penitent, ſo are wee to <hi>ſtand in the doores with a flaming ſword in our mouthes,</hi> againſt thoſe that are obſtinate.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee a <hi>neceſſity</hi> is laid vpon vs to <hi>preach</hi> vnto you; to preach <hi>not the Goſpell onely,</hi> but the Law too. Yet is not this neceſſity, <hi>neceſſitas coactionis,</hi> a neceſſity of coaction, conſtraint or compulſion, but <hi>neceſſitas obligationis &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dati diuini,</hi> a neceſſity of obligation and diuine Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. It is our vocation and conſcience that impoſeth this <hi>neceſſity</hi> vpon vs. If then we <hi>preach</hi> vnto you, wee haue not whereof to glory or boaſt our ſelues. For we doe no more than we are of duty to doe. Now if we of duty <hi>preach</hi> vnto you, then are you of duty likewiſe to <hi>heare</hi> vs: and a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of hearing is laid vpon you: I ſay not, a <hi>neceſſity of coaction,</hi> conſtraint or compulſion, but a <hi>neceſſity of obligation</hi> and diuine Commandement. A <hi>neceſſity</hi> is laid vpon you to heare the word of God, God commandeth you to heare it. And <hi>Vae vobis,</hi> Woe vnto you if you refuſe to heare it. Yet when you heare, take heed how you heare.</p>

                  <p>By this <hi>iniunction</hi> for the <hi>Proclamation</hi> now expounded, you ſee, that <hi>Heathens,</hi> the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> and <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> aliens from the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and vtter enemies to that State, are inuited to be ſpectators of the euils which <hi>God</hi> in <hi>iudgement</hi> was to bring vpon that his people, the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Nation. And this was to make the euils, which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were to ſuffer, the more grieuous vnto them. Hence ariſeth this obſeruation:
<q>The calamities, or miſeries which the <hi>Lord</hi> in iuſtice layeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs for our euill deeds, will be the more grieuous vnto vs, if our <hi>enemies</hi> be made priuie vnto them.</q>

                  <p>This is it the <hi>Lord</hi> ſaith to <hi>Ieruſalem, Ezech.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Behold,</hi> I, <hi>euen I, will execute iudgement, in the midſt of thee, in the ſight of the nations</hi> thine enemies. In the ſight of thine <hi>enemies</hi> will I doe it.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>I commend not <hi>Saul</hi> for his valour in <hi>killing</hi> himſelfe, nor <hi>Abimelech</hi> for his in cauſing his Armour-bearer to thruſt him thorow.

                     <hi>Selfe-killing</hi> is a ſinne ſo grieuous, that ſcarce there is any more hainous before the Lord.

                  <p>My firſt reaſon ſhall be; becauſe it is forbidden in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.13.</note> In that Commandement is forbidden the <hi>killing</hi> of any man without <hi>lawfull authority.</hi> But no man hath <hi>authority</hi> ouer himſelfe, becauſe no man is ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to himſelfe: and therefore no man may kill himſelfe: Out of <hi>S. Auguſtine lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Ciuit. Dei, cap.</hi> 20. I thus frame the reaſon: <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> that is the Law. The Law is not,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.13.</note> thou ſhalt not kill thy <hi>neighbour,</hi> limiting it as it were <hi>to ſome,</hi> but indefinitly; Thou ſhalt not kill, extending it largely <hi>to all:</hi> and therefore a man may not <hi>kill himſelfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My ſecond reaſon I take from that other Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi> It is giuen in the <hi>Old:</hi>

Thou oughteſt to loue thy neighbour, but as thou <hi>loueſt thy ſelfe.</hi> The example of thy charity is drawne from thy ſelfe at home. Thy ſoule, thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation, the good wiſhed <hi>to thy ſelfe,</hi> ſhould be the true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of thy deeds <hi>vnto thy neighbour.</hi> But it is vnlawfull for thee to lay bloudy or murthering hands <hi>vpon thy neighbour;</hi> and therefore thou mayeſt not <hi>make away thy ſelfe.</hi> It is more vnnaturall for thee to ſhed thine <hi>owne</hi> bloud, than thy <hi>neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi> Thy neighbours <hi>thou mayeſt not ſhed,</hi> much leſſe mayeſt thou ſhed thine owne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for a man <hi>to kill himſelfe,</hi> it is an iniury to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth wherein he liueth; for thereby he maimeth the Common-wealth, and cutteth off one of her members. The <hi>King</hi> thereby ſhall want a man, when he hath vſe of him. This
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1736:427"/> is an iniury to the State, &amp; therfore a man may not <hi>kill himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, our life is giuen vs of God. God hath placed vs in this world, as in a <hi>watch</hi> or <hi>ſtanding,</hi> from whence we may not <hi>ſtirre a foot,</hi> till God call vs and command vs to remoue.</p>

                  <p>Theſe, beloued, theſe are fit patternes for our imitation. Wherefore, let vs not be diſmaid with any <hi>croſſe</hi> or <hi>affliction.</hi> Let not the <hi>extremity</hi> of the paine, nor the <hi>ſharpneſſe</hi> of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, nor the <hi>continuance</hi> of the ſickneſſe, daunt our courage, no, though theſe <hi>calamities</hi> befall vs in the ſight of <hi>our enemies.</hi> Nay, though we be giuen vp into the hands of <hi>our enemies,</hi> who will triumph and reioyce at our downefall, yet will we not offer <hi>violent hands</hi> vnto our ſelues; wee will not <hi>cut aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> that which God hath ioyned, we will not ſeeke for eaſe by <hi>ſhortning</hi> of our liues. Whatſoeuer ill ſhall betide me, I will ſay with <hi>Ieremie, Chap.</hi> 10.19. <hi>Truly this is my griefe, and I will beare it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And my griefe will be the more, if in time of miſery, <hi>mine enemie</hi> inſult and triumph ouer me. This is a caſe, that hath much troubled Gods holy ones, as in part you haue already heard.

                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame <hi>Dauid,</hi> vpon the newes of the death of <hi>King Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan his ſonne,</hi> willing to preuent the opprobrious and diſgracefull inſultations and vpbraidings of the enemie, giues a charge for ſecrecie, as much as might be, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Tell it not in</hi> Gath, <hi>publiſh it not in the ſtreets of</hi> Askelon, <hi>leſt the daughters of the</hi> Philiſtines <hi>reioyce, leſt the daughters of the</hi> vncircumciſed <hi>triumph.</hi>

                  <p>The little flocke of the righteous, the <hi>holy Church</hi> her ſelfe, is ſenſible of the inſolencie of an <hi>enemie, Micah.</hi> 7.8. <hi>O thou enemie of mine, reioyce not at my fall; for I ſhall get vp againe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vpon theſe particulars, and the like, dependeth the truth of the obſeruation propounded:
<q>The calamities or miſeries which the <hi>Lord</hi> in iuſtice layeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs for our euill deeds, will be the more grieuous vnto vs, if our <hi>enemies</hi> be made priuie vnto them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:1736:428"/>
                  <p>Will they be the more grieuous vnto vs, if <hi>our enemies</hi> be made priuy vnto them? What is the reaſon? The reaſon is; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a propertie of <hi>wicked</hi> men, <hi>enemies</hi> to piety, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to inſult ouer the godly that are afflicted, and the more <hi>theſe</hi> are afflicted, the more inſolent are <hi>they.</hi> Great was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencie of thoſe enemies of <hi>Dauid,</hi> of whom he complaineth <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.15. <hi>In mine aduerſity they reioyced, and gathered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues together;</hi> yea, <hi>the very abiects,</hi> [the off-ſcouring of the people] <hi>gathered themſelues together againſt me; made mowes at me, and ceaſed not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As great was that of <hi>Nabal,</hi> in his anſwer to <hi>Dauids</hi> meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.10. <hi>Who is</hi> Dauid? <hi>and who is the ſonne of</hi> Ieſſe? <hi>There be many ſeruants now adayes that breake away eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man from his</hi> Maſter. <hi>Shall I then take my bread, and my wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and my fleſh that I haue killed for my ſhearers, and giue it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, when I know not whence they be?</hi> Churliſh <hi>Nabal;</hi> he is not content only not to giue any thing to <hi>Dauid,</hi> but alſo <hi>rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth at him,</hi> and reuileth him.</p>
                  <p>And was not the inſolencie of <hi>Shemei</hi> of as high a ſtraine? <hi>Shemei,</hi> a man of the family of the houſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> comes forth from <hi>Bahurim,</hi> and curſeth ſtill as hee comes, meets <hi>Dauid,</hi> caſts ſtones at him, and reuileth him; <hi>Come out, come out thou man of bloud, and thou man of Belial,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7. See, ſee; it is the property of the <hi>wicked</hi> exceedingly to inſult ouer the <hi>Godly,</hi> when they are in miſery: and for this cauſe will our miſeries be the more grieuous vnto vs, if the <hi>wicked</hi> take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them.</p>
                  <p>Now the vſes which we are to make of this obſeruation, are theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it ſheweth, how vile our nature is, that hath no more remorſe in it towards them that are in <hi>miſery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it teacheth vs when we are in <hi>miſery</hi> to looke for no better from prophane perſons, than <hi>inſultation</hi> and <hi>reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,</hi> and therefore in that caſe to arme our ſelues with <hi>patience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, wee may learne from hence how to behaue our ſelues towards our enemies, when they are fallen vnder the croſſe, wee may not <hi>triumph ouer them.</hi> Wee muſt doe vnto
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1736:429"/> them, as we would be done vnto: this is <hi>the Law</hi> and <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> But <hi>when we are in miſery, we would not haue our enemies inſult ouer vs:</hi> and therefore neither muſt we inſult ouer them, when they are in miſery.</p>
                  <p>This is that the Lord ſo ſeuerely commandeth in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie of <hi>Obadiah,</hi> verſ. 11, 12. <hi>Looke not, reioyce not, ſpeake not proudly in the day of thy brother,</hi> in the day of his <hi>peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> in the day of his <hi>perdition,</hi> in the day of his <hi>anguiſh,</hi> in the day of his <hi>ruine,</hi> in the day of his <hi>calamitie,</hi> in the day of his <hi>tribulation.</hi> And this is that, whereto <hi>Salomon</hi> exhorteth, <hi>Prou.</hi> 24.17. <hi>Reioyce not, when thine</hi> enemie <hi>falleth; and let not thine heart be glad when</hi> he <hi>ſtumbleth.</hi> So <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth, Chap 7.11. <hi>Laugh no man to ſcorne in the bitterneſſe of his ſoule.</hi> Holy <hi>Iob,</hi> Chap. 31.29. in the <hi>Catalogue</hi> of his comforts, reckoneth vp this for one; that he neuer reioyced <hi>at the hurt of his enemie,</hi> nor was euer glad <hi>that any harme hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened vnto him,</hi> nor euer-ſuffered his <hi>mouth to doe ſuch a ſinne</hi> as to <hi>wiſh him euill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now (beloued) if neither the precept of the <hi>Lord,</hi> nor the exhortation of <hi>Salomon,</hi> nor the admonition of the wiſe ſonne of <hi>Syrach,</hi> nor the example of holy <hi>Iob,</hi> can moue vs to the performance of this Chriſtian duty, namely, not to reioyce at any that are in aduerſitie: What ſhall I ſay? Will the feare of puniſhment any whit amend vs? Then remember we what the <hi>Wiſe-man</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prou.</hi> 17.5. <hi>He that reioyceth at the harme of another, ſhall not himſelfe eſcape vnpuniſhed.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Wherein three things are principally to be obſerued:
<list>
                        <item>One is, the <hi>calling of an aſſembly.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Secondly, the <hi>place</hi> for the aſſembly.</item>
                        <item>Thirdly, the <hi>end</hi> of their meeting.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:1736:429"/>
                  <p>The <hi>calling of the Aſſembly</hi> is firſt. You that are the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of the Lord, <hi>dicite,</hi> ſay plainly and with a loud voice; ſay to the Princes of <hi>Palaeſtina</hi> and of <hi>Aegypt, Congregamini,</hi> Be yee gathered together; aſſemble your ſelues, Come and meet together vpon the mountaines of <hi>Samaria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>mountaines</hi> of <hi>Samaria,</hi> are the place for this aſſembly. <hi>Samaria,</hi> for the moſt common vſe of the name, is the City re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16.24. to be built by King <hi>Omrie,</hi> vpon a mountaine purchaſed by him of one <hi>Semer,</hi> called in the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, <hi>Ezech</hi> 23.4 <hi>Aholah,</hi> ſiſter to <hi>Aholibah,</hi> named to be the <hi>head of Ephraim, Eſai.</hi> 7.9. It was a royall city of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis,</hi> the <hi>mother city</hi> of that kingdome. From it the coaſt adioyning, ſituate betwixt <hi>Galilee</hi> and <hi>Iudaea,</hi> was named <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi> and is accordingly deſcribed by Coſmographers, <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomee, Ortelias, Maginus</hi> and others: and from hence the <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came to be called the <hi>kingdome</hi> of <hi>Samaria,</hi> as 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.24. Where the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> is ſaid to haue brought nations out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and other places of his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and to haue ſeated them in the <hi>cities</hi> of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that is, in the <hi>cities</hi> of the <hi>kingdome</hi> of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus may <hi>Samaria</hi> be either the whole Prouince, or the chiefe Citie thereof. And ſo may the mountaines of <hi>Samaria</hi> be either the <hi>whole Prouince,</hi> becauſe the whole was mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> affirmeth, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de bello Iudaice, cap.</hi> 2. or they may betoken the <hi>chiefe Citie</hi> thereof, becauſe it was ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on a <hi>mountaine.</hi> And then our Prophet ſaith, the <hi>moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines</hi> of <hi>Samaria,</hi> as we ſay in Latine, <hi>flumen Euphratis, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbs Romae,</hi> and <hi>herba Lapathi.</hi> As we ſay, the <hi>Riuer of Euphrates</hi> for <hi>Euphrates,</hi> the <hi>Citie of Rome,</hi> for <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>herbe of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> for <hi>Patience:</hi> ſo may our Prophet here ſay, the <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of Samaria,</hi> for <hi>Samaria.</hi> That by theſe <hi>Mountaines of Samaria</hi> the <hi>whole Prouince</hi> is to be vnderſtood, it is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saint <hi>Hieroms, Remigius, Rupertus,</hi> with ſome other, with whom agreeth <hi>Petrus Luſitanus.</hi> Yet to <hi>Caſtrus</hi> it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth more probable, that the very <hi>Citie</hi> be here meant, as in <hi>the middeſt whereof</hi> many deteſtable villanies and enormities were acted. But both expoſitions may well take place. For if
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1736:430"/> the <hi>chiefe citie</hi> of the Countrey were ſo flagitious, <hi>the reſt</hi> of the Countrey could not be blameleſſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus haue we the place for this aſſembly. But what is the end of their meetings? It is to behold <hi>the great tumults in the middeſt of Samaria, and the oppreſſed in the middeſt thereof. Et videte,</hi> And behold.</p>
                  <p>You, the Princes of <hi>Palaſtina</hi> and <hi>Aegypt</hi> hauing gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red your ſelues together vpon the mountaines of <hi>Samaria, Videte,</hi> Looke about you.

                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe preſſeth the example of the Gentiles, the more to accuſe the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of grieuous ſinne among them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. It <hi>is reported commonly, that there is</hi> forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <hi>among you, and ſuch</hi> fornication, <hi>as is not ſo much as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med among the</hi> Gentiles. The <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who know not <hi>God,</hi> nor haue heard of the faith of Chriſt, will not commit ſo foule a ſinne: and will you, Chriſtians, you who hope for ſaluation by faith in Chriſt, will you defile your ſelues with ſuch abomination? For the loue of God, for the loue of your owne ſoules, <hi>flye from fornication.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus haue you the confirmation of my ſecond obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, which was:
<q>God ſometimes conuinceth his owne people of impiety, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them with forreine Nations.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vſe of this obſeruation may be, to teach vs, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the faith of Chriſt, that the <hi>glorious name of Chriſtianity</hi> is but vaine and idle, if a <hi>mans life</hi> through his corrupt and diſſolute behauiour, be not anſwerable.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his time propounded this queſtion to an Auditory of his, in his ſecond Sermon vpon the thirtieth Pſalme: <hi>Quam multos putatis, fratres mei, velle eſſe Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos, ſed offendi malos moribus Chriſtianorum?</hi> My brethren, how many, thinke ye, there are, that would willingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſtians, but that they take exception at the <hi>euill liues</hi> of the Chriſtians?</p>
                  <p>Long after him great <hi>Gregory, Moral. lib.</hi> 25. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained: <hi>Nonnulli fidem medullitèr tenent, ſed viuere fideliter nullatenùs curant;</hi> Many there are that make profeſſion of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1736:431"/> the <hi>faith</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but they take no care at any hand to liue the <hi>life</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The life of a Chriſtian,</hi> if you take it in its full perfection, is not ſuch a kinde of life, as the Chriſtians vſe to liue at this day in the world; but ſuch a life, as our Sauiour Chriſt liued, ſuch as his <hi>Diſciples</hi> liued, ſuch as the holy <hi>Martyrs</hi> vnder the Primitiue Church did liue: <hi>a life</hi> that is a continuall <hi>croſſe</hi> and <hi>death</hi> of the whole man; whereby man thus mortified and annihilated, is fit to be transformed into the ſimilitude and likeneſſe of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But where is the Chriſtian, that now adayes liueth ſuch a life? Hath not diſſimulation and hypocriſie in a manner co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the face of the Earth? <hi>Chriſti nomen auditis,</hi> you heare the <hi>name</hi> of Chriſt, but where ſhall you ſee the man that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the <hi>life</hi> of Chriſt? <hi>Crepamus Euangelium,</hi> we cry, <hi>the Gospell, the Gospell;</hi> but where is he that yeeldeth obedience to the Goſpell? <hi>Doctrinam fidei ebuccinamus,</hi> we trumpet out the Doctrine of faith, but the diſcipline of a Chriſtian life we exterminate, we baniſh. <hi>Multa paſſim fides abſque operibus,</hi> euery where there is much ſpeech of the efficacie <hi>of faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out workes;</hi> but where is the man that ſheweth me his <hi>faith</hi> by his <hi>workes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beloued, what ſhall I ſay more? If we haue a delight to be called the <hi>people of God,</hi> if wee take any ioy in the name of a Chriſtian, let it be our care to liue as it becommeth the <hi>people of God,</hi> as it becommeth Chriſtians. If we ſhall ſo lead our liues, that our liues ſhall be to the vnbeleeuing <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> and blinde <hi>Papiſt,</hi> a horrour and a ſcandall, ſhall they not both, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt</hi> and <hi>Papiſt,</hi> riſe vp in iudgement with vs and condemne vs? If vnder the cloake of Chriſtian libertie, we liue petulant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, laſciuiouſly, diſſolutely, in <hi>gluttony,</hi> in <hi>drunkenneſſe,</hi> in <hi>cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering,</hi> in <hi>wantonneſſe,</hi> in <hi>whoredome,</hi> in <hi>luxuriouſneſſe,</hi> in <hi>ſtrife,</hi> in <hi>maliciouſneſſe,</hi> in <hi>cruelty,</hi> in <hi>couetouſneſſe,</hi> and in other like enormities, ſhall they not both, <hi>Atheiſt</hi> and <hi>Papiſt,</hi> riſe vp in iudgement with vs, and condemne vs?</p>

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1736:433"/> paſſage of <hi>Amos</hi> his ſecond Sermon to the Kingdome of the <hi>ten Tribes,</hi> the people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Of this paſſage there are two parts:
<list>
                        <item>An <hi>Accuſation, verſ.</hi> 9, 10.</item>
                        <item>A <hi>Commination, verſ.</hi> 11.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ninth verſe, <hi>a part of the accuſation,</hi> two things haue beene obſerued:</p>
                  <p>An <hi>iniunction for a proclamation:</hi> Publiſh in the palaces, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>proclamation it ſelfe,</hi> Aſſemble your ſelues, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In the proclamation two ſinnes were controlled:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Couetouſneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their <hi>Cruelty</hi> appeared in their great <hi>tumults;</hi> their <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe</hi> in their <hi>oppreſſions.</hi> I gaue a touch at both in my laſt Sermon. I now goe on with the tenth verſe, wherein theſe two enormities; <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Couetouſneſſe,</hi> are amplified by two Topickes; <hi>à genere,</hi> and <hi>à ſpecie.</hi> From the <hi>Genus</hi> thus, <hi>They know not to doe right:</hi> and thus from the <hi>Species,</hi> They <hi>ſtore vp violence and robbery in their palaces.</hi> That ſo it is God is witneſſe, for <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Neum Iehouah,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> hath ſaid it.</p>
                  <p>I beginne with the amplification from the <hi>Genus;</hi> They <hi>know not to doe right.</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> readeth according to the Hebrew, <hi>Neſcierunt,</hi> they haue not knowne. So doe they who haue either <hi>non nouerunt,</hi> as <hi>Caluin, Gualter,</hi> and <hi>Bren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius;</hi> or <hi>non norunt,</hi> as <hi>Vatablus, Mercer,</hi> and <hi>Piſcator:</hi> They <hi>haue not knowne. Tremelius</hi> and <hi>Iunius</hi> haue, <hi>vt ignorent,</hi> how they are ignorant; <hi>Druſius</hi> hath, <hi>Nam neſciunt,</hi> for they know not. There is our tranſlation. They <hi>haue not knowne,</hi> or they <hi>are ignorant,</hi> and <hi>know not, Facere rectum,</hi> to doe right. So all ſaue <hi>Ionathan,</hi> who in his Paraphraſe hath <hi>Facere le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem,</hi> to doe the Law. The meaning is good; for whoſoeuer knoweth not to doe according to the Law of God, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to doe right.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They know not to doe right] Omninò rectum facere neſciunt,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Hierome;</hi> they haue no knowledge at all <hi>to doe what right is;</hi> no knowledge to doe any good at all. So then, they of <hi>Samaria,</hi> the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> are accuſed of <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1736:433"/> Ignorance of the Law of God,</hi> and of doing thereafter, is here laid vnto their charge. It yeeldeth vnto vs this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation:
<q>Ignorance of God and his reuealed will, is a ſinne that is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and to be auoided.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is ſo. I proue it:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is <hi>againſt the Commandement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe <hi>God expreſly reproueth it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My third proofe ſhall be from <hi>the foulneſſe of this ignorance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is againſt <hi>the Commandement,</hi> againſt the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, which is, <hi>Thou ſhalt haue none other Gods but me, Exod.</hi> 20.3. The Commandement is <hi>negatiue.</hi> And the rule is, In the <hi>negatiue</hi> the <hi>affirmatiue</hi> muſt be vnderſtood, and in the <hi>affirmatiue</hi> the <hi>negatiue.</hi> Thou ſhalt haue <hi>none other Gods but me,</hi> that's the <hi>negatiue;</hi> the <hi>affirmatiue</hi> to bee vnderſtood is, Thou <hi>ſhalt haue</hi> me alone for thy God: where our knowledge of God is commanded. We are <hi>to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him,</hi> that is, we are to know and confeſſe him to be ſuch a God, as he hath reuealed himſelfe to be in his word, and in his Creatures. Now as in this <hi>affirmatiue</hi> part the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God</hi> is commanded, ſo in the <hi>negatiue</hi> is the <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God</hi> forbidden. This <hi>ignorance of God,</hi> is not only not to <hi>know,</hi> but alſo to <hi>doubt</hi> of ſuch things as God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed in his word. And ſuch is the <hi>ignorance of God</hi> that is forbidden in that firſt Commandement.</p>
                  <p>It is likewiſe forbidden, if <hi>Polanus</hi> deceiue not, in the 32. <hi>Pſalme, verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>Be ye not as the horſe, or as the mule, which haue no vnderſtanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its forbidden in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſ. cap.</hi> 4.17, 18. <hi>Walke not from henceforth as other Gentiles walke in the vanity of their minde, hauing their vnderſtanding darkned, being aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſſe of their heart.</hi> Walke not on <hi>in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;</hi> For as the <hi>knowledge of God</hi> is the true <hi>life</hi> of the ſoule; ſo on the other ſide, <hi>the ignorance of God</hi> is the <hi>death</hi> of the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Hence is that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.13. <hi>I would not haue
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:1736:434"/> you ignorant,</hi> brethren, <hi>concerning them which are aſleepe,</hi> that <hi>you ſorrow not, euen as others which haue no hope.</hi> It ſeemeth the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> were in great heauineſſe, and mourned out of meaſure when they beheld the perſecution of the Church among them. In this their heauineſſe and mourning they grew towards miſtruſt, and to be like the <hi>Heathen,</hi> which had no hope. This abuſe of theirs grew of <hi>ignorance,</hi> for that they knew not the happy eſtate of ſuch as <hi>die in the Lord.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to reforme this their error, ſaith, <hi>Brethren, I would not haue you ignorant concerning them which are aſleepe.</hi> Be yee <hi>not ignorant</hi> what is <hi>become</hi> of them; what God hath done for them. God hath tried them <hi>as gold,</hi> and made them <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> for himſelfe. Its ignorance that makes you heauy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you know not what is <hi>become of the dead.</hi> Be ye <hi>not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant</hi> concerning them, and your <hi>heauineſſe</hi> will be turned into <hi>ioy.</hi> And let this ſuffice to haue beene ſpoken to ſhew, that in reſpect of the Commandement, <hi>Ignorance of God,</hi> and <hi>his holy Will,</hi> is <hi>damnable,</hi> and <hi>to be auoided.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So is it in regard that God hath expreſly reproued it. There is a ſharpe reproofe of it, <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.3. <hi>The Oxe knoweth his ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the Aſſe his maſters Crib, but Iſrael hath not knowne,</hi> my <hi>people</hi> hath not vnderſtood. <hi>Quid ſtolidius boue, quid ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidius aſino?</hi> What is more <hi>fooliſh</hi> than the <hi>Oxe,</hi> what more <hi>ſtupid</hi> than the <hi>Aſſe?</hi> Yet thoſe bruit beaſts doe know them, by whom they are fed and nouriſhed; but <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Lords owne people, know not the Lord their God. Not much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like is that, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 8.7. <hi>The</hi> Storke <hi>in the aire knoweth her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed times, and the</hi> Turtle, <hi>and the</hi> Crane, <hi>and the</hi> Swallow <hi>obſerue the time of their comming, but</hi> my people <hi>knoweth not the iudgement of the Lord.</hi> My people, <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of my iudgements, than thoſe <hi>birds</hi> are of their appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeaſons. Both theſe reproofes are comparatiue. In the firſt, is <hi>Iſrael</hi> compared vnto <hi>beaſts;</hi> in the ſecond, to <hi>birds. Beaſts</hi> and <hi>birds</hi> haue more knowledge than <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the reproofe is abſolute, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 4.22. <hi>My people is fooliſh, they haue not knowne me:</hi> they are <hi>fooliſh children,</hi> and haue <hi>no vnderſtanding:</hi> they are <hi>wiſe</hi> to <hi>doe euill,</hi> but to <hi>doe
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1736:434"/> well</hi> they haue <hi>no knowledge.</hi> As abſolute is that, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 9.3. <hi>They proceed from euill to worſe, and haue not knowne me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> They haue <hi>no vnderſtanding,</hi> they haue <hi>no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> they haue <hi>not knowne</hi> me, ſaith the Lord. Theſe, and the like reproofes of the ignorance of God, from Gods owne mouth, may ſerue for my ſecond proofe, that <hi>the ignorance of God is damnable, and to be auoided.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My third proofe I take from the <hi>fouleneſſe</hi> of this igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. The <hi>fouleneſſe</hi> thereof I diſcouer in one poſition. The poſition is; <hi>The ignorance of God, and of the things reuealed in his holy Word, is a puniſhment of ſinne, a cauſe of ſinne, and ſinne in it ſelfe.</hi> The poſition hath three branches. I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to ſpeake of each in their order.</p>
                  <p>The firſt branch is: Our <hi>ignorance</hi> of God and of things reuealed in his holy Word, is <hi>a puniſhment of ſinne.</hi> It is a <hi>puniſhment</hi> of <hi>that ſinne,</hi> which by the default of our firſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Adam,</hi> was from him deriued downe to vs; and that is <hi>originall ſinne;</hi> by reaſon whereof we are all borne <hi>blind: blind</hi> in our vnderſtanding, <hi>blind</hi> in our will, and <hi>blind</hi> in our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. There is no faculty of our ſoule which is not diſabled by this <hi>ſinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The chiefeſt faculties of our ſoule are three, <hi>Mens, Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, Affectiones;</hi> the Vnderſtanding, the Will, and the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. <hi>Mens,</hi> Our vnderſtanding is by this ſinne diſabled: For it labours with a <hi>defect,</hi> or want <hi>of light or knowledge,</hi> and with a <hi>want</hi> of <hi>ſanctitie</hi> or <hi>holineſſe;</hi> that quality, by which <hi>light</hi> or <hi>knowledge</hi> in the vnderſtanding ſhould be ſeaſoned, as indeed it was at mans firſt creation.</p>
                  <p>That in the often repetition of the names of <hi>light</hi> and <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> I ſeeme not tedious, may it pleaſe you to take what I ſhal ſpeak of the <hi>one,</hi> as ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the <hi>other</hi> alſo. For between <hi>light</hi> &amp; <hi>knowledge</hi> in the <hi>vnderſtanding.</hi> I put no eſſentiall difference.</p>
                  <p>Now I note in the <hi>vnderſtanding</hi> a twofold <hi>light;</hi> the one <hi>naturall,</hi> the other <hi>Spirituall.</hi>
                  </p>

What! Can man exempt himſelfe from <hi>ſubiection</hi> vnto God? No: be he neuer ſo rebellious, he muſt abide vnder Gods dominion. But the meaning of the Apoſtle is, to note ſuch a rebellion of mans corrupt nature, as is not <hi>ſubiect according vnto order,</hi> as giues not <hi>orderly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection</hi> vnto God.

                  <p>What I haue now deliuered <hi>de mente,</hi> concerning the <hi>minde</hi> or <hi>vnderſtanding,</hi> which is a <hi>ſpeculatiue facultie</hi> of the ſoule,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:1736:435"/> the ſame may be ſpoken <hi>De voluntate &amp; affectionibus,</hi> of the will and affections, which are <hi>practicall</hi> faculties of the ſame. And therefore as in the vnderſtanding there is a defect of <hi>light</hi> and <hi>ſanctitie,</hi> ſo is there in the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> euen the <hi>abſence</hi> of created holineſſe.

                  <p>If the <hi>light</hi> be put out, <hi>darkneſſe</hi> comes in place; if <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> be departed, <hi>ignorance</hi> ſucceeds; if <hi>holineſſe</hi> be <hi>loſt, ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> will domineere. Proofes hereof there are many in holy Scripture. But in this <hi>ſunſhine</hi> I need not light a candle. I haue ſaid enough to ſhew, that <hi>ignorance of God and his will is in all the powers and faculties of the ſoule of man, a puniſhment of ſinne,</hi> of <hi>originall ſinne.</hi> But this puniſhment of ſinne is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, its common to all men, for as much as <hi>all men haue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I adde further, that <hi>Ignorance</hi> is alſo a puniſhment of <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſinne.</hi> Sometimes its ſo. Then it is ſo, when a man for ſome <hi>particular offence</hi> is more and more blinded, and depriued of the knowledge of God and his truth. So <hi>God</hi> puniſhed the <hi>Gentiles</hi> with ignorance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Becauſe when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, therefore God gaue them vp to vncleanneſſe through the luſts of their owne hearts to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour their owne bodies betweene themſelues.</hi> So <hi>they became vaine in their imaginations; and profeſſing themſelues wiſe, they became fooles.</hi> And ſo <hi>God</hi> puniſhed the wicked among the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Becauſe they receiued not the truth,</hi> that <hi>they might be ſaued, therefore God did ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould beleeue lies.</hi> Thus is <hi>ignorance</hi> the puniſhment alſo of <hi>actuall ſin.</hi> And now is the firſt branch of my poſition cleare:</p>

                  <p>Now our <hi>ignorance</hi> of God is a <hi>cauſe of ſinne</hi> the fourth way, namely as it is not without attendants.

                  </p>
                  <p>The third branch is: <hi>Our ignorance of God,</hi> and <hi>his truth,</hi> is <hi>in it ſelfe ſinne.</hi> Here the <hi>Schoolemen</hi> doe diſtinguiſh.<note place="margin">Aquin. <hi>1. 2.</hi> qu. <hi>76.</hi> Art. <hi>2.</hi> Lombard.

                  <p>The Text of Scripture which they alleage for their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.22. There ſaith Chriſt, <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken vnto them, they ſhould not haue had ſinne, but now haue they no cloake for their ſinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My anſwer is: Theſe words make nothing for them. For Chriſt by ſaying ſo, doth not abſolutely <hi>excuſe</hi> the <hi>Iewes</hi> from ſinne vpon the condition that they had <hi>not beene able to</hi> haue heard Chriſt. The excuſe which Chriſt fitteth to them ſerues onely to <hi>excuſe</hi> them from the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> and <hi>grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne,</hi> as if he had thus ſaid, <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken vnto them, they ſhould not haue had ſin; ſin,</hi> that is, <hi>ſo grieuous ſinne</hi> as now they haue, ſince they haue heard me, and yet doe continue in their obſtinacy, refuſing to giue aſſent to the truth, which I haue told them from my Father. <hi>They ſhould not haue had ſinne;</hi> Sinne <hi>in compariſon</hi> they ſhould not haue had.

                  <p>The place may receiue light from Chriſts owne mouth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.47.

That <hi>ſome men</hi> know him not, nor can know him, it is not Gods fault, but the fault of their owne parents, and conſequently their owne fault. <hi>Adam</hi> had the perfect knowledge of God imprinted in his nature: but through his <hi>owne</hi> default he loſt the ſame for <hi>himſelfe</hi> and his <hi>poſterity.</hi> A man may not for this complaine againſt <hi>Gods iuſtice,</hi> ſince that our <hi>firſt ſinne</hi> hath deſerued a greater puniſhment.

And this may ſerue for the illuſtration of the third part of my poſition, wherein I affirmed, that <hi>our ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of God and his truth is of it ſelfe ſinne.</hi> Now the whole together ſtands good: <hi>Our ignorance of God, and of the things reuealed in his holy word,</hi> whether it be an <hi>affected</hi> and a <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> ignorance, or a <hi>negligent</hi> and <hi>careleſſe</hi> ignorance, or an <hi>inuincible</hi> and a <hi>neceſſary</hi> ignorance, is an <hi>effect</hi> and <hi>puniſhment</hi> of ſinne, it is a <hi>cauſe</hi> of ſinne, and is <hi>in it ſelfe</hi> ſinne.

                  <p>My obſeruation thus eſtabliſhed; Let vs now ſee what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit may from hence redound vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, this may ſerue to warne all <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Word, that they be carefull to root out <hi>ignorance</hi> out of the mindes of the people, and to plant the <hi>knowledge of God</hi> among them. The <hi>Miniſter</hi> that neglects his duty, and either through inſufficiency or idleneſſe, ſuffereth the people to goe on in the waies of darkneſſe to their perdition, he becommeth acceſſary, yea a <hi>principall cauſe</hi> of their deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this may teach vs all to deteſt this <hi>ignorance of God and his reuealed will,</hi> and to ſeeke by all meanes to <hi>know God.</hi> They that content themſelues to liue in <hi>their ignorance,</hi> and voluntarily ſubmit themſelues to be led by <hi>blind guides,</hi> ſuch as cannot enforme them in the waies of the Lord, their eſtate is lamentable.

                  </p>

                  <p>In this my <hi>Theſis,</hi> by euill I vnderſtand <hi>malum poenae,</hi> the euill of <hi>puniſhment,</hi> or the euill of <hi>affliction. Affliction</hi> or <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,</hi> whereof ſinne is the cauſe, is two fold, <hi>internall</hi> or <hi>externall;</hi> either <hi>inward</hi> or <hi>outward.</hi> The <hi>inward</hi> pertaineth to the minde, the <hi>outward</hi> to the body.

                  <p>Againe, <hi>affliction</hi> or <hi>puniſhment,</hi> whereof ſinne is the <hi>cauſe,</hi> is either <hi>publike</hi> or <hi>priuate.</hi>

                  <p>Thus farre for the confirmation of my doctrine:
<q>Sinne is the cauſe of all the euill that befalleth man in this life.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine Serm.</hi> 139. <hi>de tempore,</hi> thus deliuers it: <hi>Malorum omnium noſtrorum cauſa peccatum eſt:</hi> Sinne is the <hi>cauſe</hi> of all our euills. <hi>Non enim ſine cauſâ homines mala iſta patiuntur;</hi> It is not to be imagined that men ſuffer affliction <hi>without cauſe.</hi> God is iuſt; he is omnipotent. <hi>Nullo modo iſta

This is it, the <hi>Lord</hi> aſſumeth to himſelfe, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 45.7. <hi>I the Lord; I forme the light, and create darkneſſe: I make peace, and create euill; I the Lord doe all theſe things.</hi> It is thus in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe: I am the <hi>Lord;</hi> and there is none elſe. I ſend into the world <hi>light</hi> and <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> proſperity and aduerſitie: I <hi>giue peace,</hi> and with it tranquillity and abundance, and I giue that which is contrary to peace, <hi>euill,</hi> warre, and miſery, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation, and pouertie: <hi>I, the Lord doe all theſe things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is no more than what he takes vnto himſelfe, <hi>Ier.</hi> 18.11. For there alſo, thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>Behold, I frame euill againſt you, and deuiſe a deuice againſt you:</hi> where by <hi>euill</hi> vnderſtand with <hi>Tertullian lib.</hi> 2. <hi>aduerſus Marcionem cap.</hi> 24. <hi>Mala non peccatoria, ſed vltoria,</hi> Euill not of <hi>ſinne,</hi> but of <hi>reuengement.</hi>

By <hi>euill</hi> in all ſuch places, as in this my <hi>Theſis,</hi> we are to vnderſtand the <hi>euill</hi> of <hi>reuengement,</hi> the <hi>euill</hi> of <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or the <hi>euill</hi> of <hi>affliction.</hi> Of euery ſuch euill God is the <hi>Author.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>Author of puniſhment.</hi> I ſay of <hi>puniſhment, non quòd poena ſit ens quoddam,</hi> not as if the euill of puniſhment had a being, as other things haue which God made. For God is improperly ſaid to be the <hi>efficient</hi> of puniſhment; ſith puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its owne nature,<note place="margin">Aquin. <hi>1.</hi> qu. <hi>48.</hi> Art. <hi>1.</hi> C.</note> is nothing elſe than <hi>priuatio boni,</hi> the priuation, or abſence, of that we call good; or the with-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Gods bleſſings from vs. The Father of the Schooles thus deliuers it:<note place="margin">Idem <hi>1.</hi> qu. <hi>49.</hi> Art. <hi>2.</hi> C.</note> 
                     <hi>Cum ſummum bonum perfectiſſimum ſit, mali cauſa eſſe non poteſt, niſi per accidens.</hi> God being the chiefeſt good and moſt perfect, cannot be the <hi>author of euill</hi> but by <hi>accident.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The author of euill <hi>by accident!</hi> How is that? Why thus? When God withdraweth from the earth his heauenly benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, forbidding the clouds to giue their raine, or the Sunne his influence, and taking from vs our health, our peace, or any other temporall bleſſing, hee is the <hi>author of euill.</hi> And this may ſerue for the proofe and explanation of my ſecond Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which was,
<q>Of all the euill that befalleth man in this life, God is the Author.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon hereof is, becauſe nothing is done in the world, but <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>principall doer</hi> of it: and therefore no <hi>euill</hi> can befall vs, but <hi>God</hi> is the author of it.</p>
                  <p>Is it thus? Hence then in the firſt place, are they to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, who thinke, that the Lord doth <hi>onely ſuffer</hi> many things to be done. He is not only a <hi>ſufferer,</hi> but an orderer, guider, and gouernour of all things and actions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, from hence may be confuted, the vaine opinion of <hi>Fortune,</hi> whereunto many <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and carnall ignorant people vſe to aſcribe thoſe things whereof they ſee not an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant cauſe. What more <hi>caſuall</hi> in this world than <hi>Lottery?</hi>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:1736:445"/> Yet, therein nothing falleth out by <hi>fortune,</hi> but all is wholly and altogether directed by the infinite and eternall <hi>prouidence</hi> of Almighty God: <hi>Salomon</hi> expreſly affirmeth it, <hi>Prou.</hi> 16.33. <hi>The lot is caſt into the Lap, but the whole dispoſing thereof is of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, from hence wee learne that all our <hi>afflictions</hi> are from God; and are therefore by vs to be borne with <hi>patience.</hi> God verily loueth thoſe that are his, and yet notwithſtanding he ſuffereth them to be afflicted, becauſe it is expedient for them ſo to be: yet in their afflictions he yeeldeth them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> bleſſeth God for it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed be God,</hi> euen <hi>the Father of our Lord</hi> Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>the Father of mercies,</hi> and <hi>the God of all comfort,</hi> who comforteth vs in all our tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Who <hi>comforteth vs in all our tribulation;</hi> he ſaith not, who <hi>ſuffereth</hi> vs not to be afflicted, but who <hi>comforteth</hi> vs, while we are afflicted. It is the obſeruation of <hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Theophylact.</hi> God though he <hi>ſuffer</hi> vs to be afflicted, yet he <hi>comforteth</hi> vs whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are afflicted. Our afflictions, they are <hi>Emendatoriae potiùs, quàm interfectoriae,</hi> as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de lib. Arbit. cap.</hi> 25. They tend rather to <hi>amend</hi> vs, than to <hi>deſtroy</hi> vs. And ſweetly Saint <hi>Cyprian.

<q>Gods threatning to puniſh long before he puniſheth, are inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to repentance.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Origen lib.</hi> 4. <hi>contra Celſum,</hi> ſaith, God puniſheth <hi>no man,</hi> but <hi>whom</hi> he doth <hi>firſt warne,</hi> terrifie, and aduertiſe of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill. And ſurely, herein appeareth Gods mercy, that he <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth</hi> before hee <hi>puniſheth,</hi> that by his <hi>threatning</hi> men might learne to amend. He <hi>threatneth,</hi> ſaith <hi>S. Chryſoſtome, Hom.</hi> 12. <hi>in Geneſ. Vt nobis correctis, minas ad opus minimè perducat,</hi>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:1736:446"/> that we being <hi>amended,</hi> his menacing need not take effect.</p>
                  <p>If this were not the end of <hi>Gods threatnings,</hi> why doth <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaniah Chap.</hi> 2.1, 2. thus exhort the Iewes? <hi>Gather your ſelues together, yea gather together, O Nation not deſired. Before the decree bring forth, before the day paſſe as the chaffe, before the fierce anger of the Lord come vpon you; before the day of the Lords anger come vpon you.

                  </p>
                  <p>This is that ſame <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it is the <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> the <hi>forbearance,</hi> the <hi>long ſuffering</hi> of God, whereof Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Despiſeſt thou,</hi> O man, <hi>the riches of his goodneſſe and forbearance, and long ſuffering, not knowing that the goodneſſe of God leadeth thee to repentance?</hi> It <hi>leadeth</hi> to repentance. It is vouchſafed vnto vs to the amendment of life. And thus is my obſeruation eſtabliſhed,
<q>Gods threatnings to puniſh, long before he puniſheth, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitations to repentance.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>One reaſon hereof is; becauſe if after <hi>threatning</hi> repentance follow, it procureth the forgiueneſſe of ſinne, and taketh away the <hi>cauſe</hi> of the <hi>puniſhment.</hi> Sinne is the <hi>cauſe</hi> of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; this wee heard euen now.

                  </p>
                  <p>A ſecond reaſon I take from the <hi>end</hi> of Gods <hi>threatnings.</hi> The <hi>end</hi> whereat he aimeth, when he <hi>threatneth,</hi> is not the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> of them that are threatned, but their <hi>amendment.</hi> For <hi>thus ſaith the Lord, Ezech.</hi> 18.23. <hi>Haue I any pleaſure at all
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:1736:447"/> that the wicked ſhould die, and not that he ſhould returne from his wayes and liue?</hi> This by way of <hi>interrogation.</hi> But it is by way of <hi>aſſertion, Ezech.</hi> 33.11. and is backed with an oath; <hi>As I liue ſaith the</hi> Lord God, <hi>I haue no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turne from his way and liue.</hi> As <hi>I liue,</hi> it is ſo. Here may wee ſay, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſome-where ſaid of Chriſt: <hi>Felices nos, propter quos ipſe Deus iurat;</hi> Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie are we for whom God himſelfe ſweareth. But <hi>infoelices, ſi ne iuranti quidem credimus;</hi> Wretched are we, if wee beleeue him not vpon his oath.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall but point at the vſes of this doctrine, becauſe I haue handled them at large in my fourth <hi>Sermon</hi> vpon this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is to teach vs, that in the greateſt and moſt feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>threatnings of Gods iudgements,</hi> there is comfort remaining, hope of grace and mercy to be found, health in ſickneſſe, and life in death.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> is a warrant for vs of the Miniſtery to propound vnto you the <hi>threatnings of God</hi> with condition of repentance: and thus we offer vnto you grace and mercy, to as many of you, as ſhall be of humble and contrite hearts.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> is a warning vnto <hi>you,</hi> to all that haue this grace and fauour with God to be <hi>hearers</hi> of his holy word. It is your parts whenſoeuer you ſhall heare of the <hi>threatnings</hi> of Gods iudgements againſt ſinners, to ſtirre vp your ſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to repentance, thereby to preuent the wrath of God and to ſtay his iudgements.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> is to aſſure vs, that if God <hi>threaten</hi> and no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance follow, then certainly the <hi>threatnings</hi> pronounced will come to paſſe. God <hi>threatneth not in vaine,</hi> nor doth he <hi>terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie vs</hi> without cauſe. If we preuent not his <hi>threatnings</hi> by true repentance, his <hi>threatnings</hi> will preuent vs by iuſt execution.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>God is he that <hi>raiſeth</hi> vp enemies againſt a Land to inuade it. Did not God <hi>ſend them,</hi> they could doe nothing againſt vs.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon is, becauſe they haue <hi>no power</hi> againſt vs, except it be giuen them by God. So <hi>Chriſt</hi> told <hi>Pilate, Ioh.</hi> 19.11. <hi>Thou couldeſt haue no power at all againſt me, except it were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thee from aboue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vſes follow. One is to teach vs not to feare <hi>man,</hi> but <hi>God,</hi> that giues power vnto man.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond is to admoniſh vs, that wee be not like the <hi>dogge</hi> that ſnatcheth at the ſtone that is caſt at him without regard vnto the thrower. If <hi>God ſend</hi> an enemie to inuade vs, our eye muſt be vpon <hi>God</hi> that ſendeth him.</p>

                  <p>This is that we reade, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 26.5.

                  </p>
                  <p>One reaſon is, becauſe God <hi>ouerthroweth</hi> the <hi>greateſt ſtrength</hi> that man can erect, euen at his pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond is, becauſe there is <hi>no ſtrength,</hi> but it is of God and from God. <hi>Vaſtatum ſuperrobuſtum roborat, Amos</hi> 5.9. God aboue is he that <hi>ſtrengthneth</hi> the <hi>ſpoiled</hi> againſt the <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and maketh <hi>the ſpoiled to come with might againſt the fortreſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will but name the vſes. One is, to teach vs, neuer to put any affiance in our <hi>owne ſtrength,</hi> but ſo to vſe all good meanes for
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:1736:449"/> our defence, that ſtill wee rely vpon the Lord for ſucceſſe.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond is, to ſtop vs from glorying in <hi>our ſtrength.</hi> There is a caueat againſt it, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 9.23. Let <hi>not the ſtrong man glory in his ſtrength.</hi> If he will needs glory, let him glory <hi>in the Lord.</hi> Let his glorying be in imitation of the royall Prophet, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 18.2. <hi>The Lord is my rocke,</hi> and my <hi>fortreſſe,</hi> and my <hi>deliuerer:</hi> my <hi>God,</hi> my ſtrength in whom I will truſt, my <hi>buckler</hi> and the <hi>horne</hi> of <hi>my ſaluation,</hi> and my <hi>high tower.</hi> The Lord is my <hi>ſtrength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third is to admoniſh vs of a duty of ours, which is, in trouble ſometimes, yea alwayes, to approach vnto the throne of grace by humble prayer, to begge of God his protection againſt all the aſſaults of <hi>our enemies,</hi> that they neuer preuaile againſt vs to take away <hi>our ſtrength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am come to my laſt circumſtance, the circumſtance of the <hi>ſpoile,</hi> in theſe words,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Et diripientur palatia tua,</hi> And thy <hi>palaces</hi> ſhall be ſpoiled. The <hi>Vulgar Latine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Diripientur aedes tuae,</hi> thy houſes ſhall be ſpoiled. <hi>Petrus Luſitanus</hi> preferreth <hi>Palaces,</hi> as beſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> He is in the right. <hi>palaces</hi> are named, becauſe <hi>Conquerours</hi> when they haue wonne a <hi>City</hi> by aſſault, doe enter into the faireſt, ſtatelieſt, and moſt princely houſes, preſuming to finde in them the greateſt booties.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Palaces</hi> are by ſome taken <hi>Metonymically</hi> to ſignifie either the <hi>goods</hi> heaped vp in them,<note place="margin">Albertus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> or the <hi>poſſeſſions</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them.</p>
                  <p>Wee ſhall not doe amiſſe if wee follow the <hi>letter,</hi> and take theſe <hi>Palaces,</hi> as they are, for the <hi>Palaces</hi> of <hi>Samaria,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Princes, Magiſtrates, and Rulers of <hi>Samaria,</hi> did ſtore vp the treaſures of <hi>violence</hi> and <hi>robbery,</hi> as wee ſaw vpon the <hi>former verſe.</hi> So the meaning may be thus: <hi>Palatia tua,</hi> Thy Palaces, <hi>O Samaria,</hi> which were as the receptacles, caues, or dens, in which thou didſt treaſure vp thy goods gotten from the poore by violence and wrong, <hi>diripientur,</hi> they ſhall be ſpoiled: thou haſt ſpoiled others, therefore ſhalt thou thy ſelfe be ſpoiled. <hi>Sic erit poena ſceleri conſentiens;</hi> ſo ſhall the <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> be agreeable to the <hi>offence.</hi> Obſerue here,
<q>
                        <pb n="232" facs="tcp:1736:450"/>Puniſhments are moſt vſually in the like; proper and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable <hi>to the</hi> offences.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is that which is vulgarly ſaid, <hi>In quo quis peccat, in eo punitur;</hi> as a man offendeth, in the ſame manner will God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him.</p>
                  <p>They who ſought the life of <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſinned in cauſing him to be caſt into the <hi>Lions den.</hi> How were they for ſo ſinning pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed? God might haue reuenged himſelfe vpon them by his owne immediate hand, but would not.

                  <p>It was <hi>Dauids</hi> ſinne to commit <hi>adultery</hi> with <hi>

He was paid home and puniſhed in his <hi>owne kinde.</hi> To reward and ſerue him, as he had ſerued others, God as a iuſt Iudge raiſeth vp euill againſt him out of his owne houſe.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.10.</note> His <hi>owne ſonnes</hi> breake out into the <hi>ſame ſinnes;</hi> they riſe vp againſt him, and one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. A tent is ſpread for <hi>Abſolom</hi> vpon the houſe top, and he lyeth with his <hi>fathers Concubines</hi> in the <hi>ſight of all Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.22. <hi>Amnon</hi> deflowreth his ſiſter <hi>Tamar,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.14. to reuenge this, <hi>Abſolom</hi> cauſeth his brother <hi>Amnon</hi> to be ſlaine, verſ. 28.</p>
                  <p>Bloud requireth bloud. Hereof are we aſſured, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9 6. <hi>Who ſo ſheddeth mans bloud, by man</hi> ſhall <hi>his bleud be ſhed.</hi> So ſaith our <hi>Sauiour</hi> in the Goſpell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.51. <hi>All they that take the ſword, ſhall periſh with the ſword.</hi> The like is that in the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> Chap. 13.10. <hi>He that killeth with the ſword,</hi> muſt <hi>be killed with the ſword.</hi> Bloud requireth bloud. And though peraduenture a <hi>murtherer</hi> doe eſcape the hand of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, yet will the vengeance of God finde him out. We ſee this in <hi>Ioab:</hi> he ſhed innocent bloud, the bloud of <hi>Abner,</hi> and <hi>Amaſa,</hi> two Captaines of the Hoſts of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Hee eſcaped a long time, as if his <hi>murthers</hi> had beene forgotten, but at length vengeance <hi>came home</hi> vnto him, and ſuffered not his <hi>hoare head to goe downe to the graue in peace;</hi> for his <hi>bloud</hi> was <hi>ſhed,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.34.</p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:1736:450"/>
                  <p>Memorable is the example of <hi>Adoni-Bezek,</hi> who being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Simeon,</hi> had his <hi>thumbes</hi> and <hi>great toes</hi> cut off. Herein he confeſſed that the iuſtice of God had found him out, and requited him in his kinde, according to his own cruelty. For ſaith he, <hi>Threeſcore and ten Kings, hauing their thumbes and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat vnder my table: as I haue done, ſo God hath requited me, Iudg.</hi> 1.7. Thus was <hi>cruelty</hi> repaid with <hi>crueltie</hi> in the <hi>ſame kinde.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A like example is that of <hi>Agag,</hi> King of the <hi>Amalekites.</hi> He hauing made <hi>many a woman childleſſe,</hi> is repaid in the like; and is himſelfe hewed in peeces by <hi>Samuel,</hi> with this <hi>Item; As thy ſword hath made women childleſſe, ſo ſhall thy mother be child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe among women,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.33.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Haman</hi> ſet vp a gallowes to hang vp <hi>Mordecai, Haman</hi> may be the <hi>firſt</hi> that ſhall be <hi>hanged thereon, Esther</hi> 7.10.</p>
                  <p>It is the law of equalitie and equitie, that men <hi>ſuffer</hi> the <hi>ſame things</hi> of others, which they haue <hi>offered</hi> vnto others. Our <hi>Sauiour Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>Sermon</hi> vpon the Mount thus deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers it; <hi>With what meaſure yee mete,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 6.38.</note> 
                     <hi>it ſhall be meaſured to you againe, Matth.</hi> 7.2. Whereupon one ſaith after this manner; He that <hi>raſhly</hi> and <hi>vniuſtly cenſureth</hi> others, feeleth at one time or other the ſmart of it in the like kinde. For God doth iuſtly raiſe vp others to <hi>cenſure him,</hi> that thereby he may be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed. According to this law of <hi>equitie</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Reu.</hi> 3.10. <hi>He that leadeth into captiuity, ſhall be led into captiuity:</hi> And <hi>Eſay</hi> 33.1. <hi>They that deale treacherouſly with others, ſhall haue others to deale treacherouſly with them;</hi> and <hi>they that ſpoile o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> ſhall <hi>themſelues be ſpoiled.</hi> This laſt is the very meaſure, that is in this my text threatned to the ten Tribes. They <hi>ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the poore,</hi> treaſuring vp in their palaces the goods taken from them by violence and robbery, and therefore ſhall their palaces be <hi>ſpoiled.</hi> Thus farre is the confirmation of my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which was,
<q>Puniſhments are moſt vſually in the like: proper and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the offences.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Are <hi>puniſhments</hi> proportionable to the <hi>offences?</hi> One rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hereof may be, becauſe the <hi>iuſtice of God</hi> is hereby cleared,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:1736:451"/> and the mouth of iniquitie ſtopped. When God retaileth vs according to the ſinne that we haue committed, what can we alleage or anſwer for our ſelues? Surely, we cannot haue any excuſe, pretence or allegation for our ſelues, but muſt confeſſe with our owne mouth, and againſt our ſelues, that <hi>God is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> and that our ſelues are wicked.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond reaſon may be taken from the <hi>equity</hi> of this kinde of proceeding. It is meet that <hi>malefactors</hi> haue their deſerts; nor can they complaine of <hi>iniuſtice,</hi> ſo long as they receiue <hi>their owne.</hi> God will giue <hi>to euery man according to his workes:</hi> he will giue them wages according to their deſeruings. Vpon this <hi>equity</hi> is grounded the Law of <hi>retaliation,</hi> by which God requireth of the hands of Magiſtrates, that they recompence <hi>life</hi> for <hi>life, eye</hi> for <hi>eye, tooth</hi> for <hi>tooth, hand</hi> for <hi>hand, foot</hi> for <hi>foot, burning</hi> for <hi>burning, wound</hi> for <hi>wound, ſtripe</hi> for <hi>ſtripe, Exod.</hi> 21.23. The Law is repeated, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 24.19, 20. If <hi>a man cauſe a blemiſh in his neighbour: as hee hath done,</hi> ſo <hi>ſhall it be done vnto</hi> him. <hi>Breach</hi> for <hi>breach, eye</hi> for <hi>eye, tooth</hi> for <hi>tooth;</hi> as he hath cauſed <hi>a blemiſh</hi> in a man, ſo ſhall it be done <hi>to him againe.</hi> Now if God hath made a law for <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the ſinner according to the manner of his ſinne, we may not doubt but that God himſelfe will meaſure his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments according to the rule of iuſtice and equitie. Vpon the ground of theſe reaſons, my doctrine ſtandeth,
<q>Puniſhments are moſt vſually in the like; proper and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the offences.</q>
                  </p>

<q>It is not lawfull for any man to take vpon him miniſteriall function in the Church without aſſurance of calling from God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This truth is by the <hi>Apoſtle, Hebr.</hi> 5.4. thus deliuered: <hi>No man taketh this honour to himſelfe,</hi> but <hi>he that is called of God, as</hi> Aaron <hi>was.</hi> Now that <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes were conſecrated to the Prieſts office by the authority and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, it is plaine by the eighth Chapter of <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> wherein are ſet downe the ſacrifices and ceremonies vſed at the <hi>Conſecration,</hi> together with the place and time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Thereby it appeareth, that the office of holy <hi>Prieſt-hood</hi> was not <hi>of man,</hi> nor <hi>from man;</hi> but <hi>God Almighty</hi> did firſt inſtitute and ordaine it by his owne expreſſe commandement. Then being ordained, he confirmed the honour and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it, by that great miracle of the <hi>budding</hi> of <hi>Aarons</hi> rod, <hi>Num.</hi> 17.8.

                  <p>As the <hi>Miniſter</hi> holds, his <hi>calling</hi> from God, ſo doth euery other <hi>member</hi> of the Church. There is not a <hi>member</hi> of the Church, <hi>man</hi> or <hi>woman,</hi> but holds a particular <hi>ſtanding</hi> and <hi>function</hi> from God, and is ranked in order by Gods ſpeciall prouidence and calling. And it is to great purpoſe, that you all know this in your owne particulars. For</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it enforceth <hi>diligence.</hi> If God hath ſet thee in thy <hi>calling,</hi> then it ſtands thee vpon to diſcharge <hi>the duties of thy calling</hi> with all ſedulity and alacrity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it may admoniſh thee <hi>not to paſſe the bounds of thy calling.</hi> Seeing thou art in thy place by the Will of God, thou muſt take heed that thou goe not beyond thy limits, either by vſing vnlawfull courſes, or by intruding into other mens functions.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it may teach thee that thy <hi>particular calling</hi> is to ſerue the <hi>generall.</hi> Euery Chriſtian hath <hi>two</hi> callings; a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,</hi> and a <hi>generall.</hi> The <hi>particular,</hi> which is alſo <hi>perſonall,</hi> is the externall deſignment of a man, to ſome outward ſeruice in the Church or common wealth, to the diſcharge of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall duties in regard of the diſtinction betweene man and man. The <hi>generall calling</hi> is the calling of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> it is the ſingling out of a man by ſpeciall ſanctification to glorifie God, and to ſeeke out his owne ſaluation in the things of the Kingdome of Chriſt: this is common to <hi>euery member</hi> of the Church, to <hi>all beleeuers.</hi> Both theſe callings, <hi>generall</hi> and <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>
                     <pb n="246" facs="tcp:1736:457"/> muſt be ioyned together in our life, as the body and ſoule in man. Where they are not ioyned together, there may be a <hi>ſhew</hi> of Chriſtianity, but the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> will be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.23.</note> Chriſts Commandement, that men <hi>ſeeke firſt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God and his righteouſneſſe,</hi> is a demonſtration, that men ought not ſo to follow their outward buſineſſe and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, as to omit the meanes of <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>grace.</hi> The <hi>particular calling</hi> muſt ſerue the <hi>generall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, from this conſideration, that we hold our <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular callings</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> we are to learne <hi>contentment</hi> in the willing vndergoing of the daily <hi>moleſtations, troubles,</hi> and <hi>croſſes,</hi> that doe befall vs in our ſeuerall courſes and kinds of life. It is a leſſon, in the practiſe whereof Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had well profited. <hi>I haue learned,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in whatſoeuer ſtate I am, therewith to be content, Philip.</hi> 4.11. He knew how to bee <hi>abaſed;</hi> and he knew how to <hi>abound.</hi> Euery where and in all things he was inſtructed both to <hi>be full</hi> and to <hi>be hungry,</hi> both to <hi>abound</hi> and to <hi>ſuffer need.</hi> Let vs ſet him for the patterne of our imitation, and we will <hi>be content</hi> with what we haue, be it <hi>much</hi> or <hi>little.</hi> If we haue <hi>little,</hi> our account ſhall be the <hi>leſſe;</hi> if <hi>more,</hi> we are bound to doe the <hi>more good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I haue done with the <hi>Introduction</hi> to the <hi>ſimilitude:</hi> It is time that I proceed with the <hi>ſimilitude</hi> it ſelfe.</p>
                  <q>As the ſhepheard taketh out of the mouth of the Lion two legs or a peece of an eare, ſo ſhall the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> bee taken out that dwell in <hi>Samaria,</hi> in the corner of a bed, and in <hi>Damaſcus</hi> in a couch.</q>
                  <p>Hereof I finde diuers expoſitions. Some will haue this <hi>ſimilitude</hi> to ſignifie, that few of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhall be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the ſpoile of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and thoſe ſuch as ſhall be <hi>ſicke, weake,</hi> and <hi>feeble,</hi> and therefore ſhall be <hi>deſpiſed</hi> and left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind as vnprofitable, and of no vſe to be carried into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity. And this is the expoſition of <hi>Theodoret, Vatabius, Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, Rupertus,</hi> and <hi>Montanus. Chriſtophorus à Caſtro</hi> thus giues it in his paraphraſe: <hi>As when a Lion hath eaten his fill, and hath ſatiate his hunger, the ſhepheard findeth</hi> two legs, or a leg, or a peece of an eare, <hi>to ſhew that the ſheepe hath beene wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The third expoſition is <hi>Lyraes;</hi> He will haue this <hi>ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> to ſignifie, that <hi>very few of the Iſraelites ſhall bee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,</hi> and they ſuch, as ſhall eſcape by flight either to King <hi>Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Of theſe expoſitions I preferre the ſecond, which I tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in my diuiſion of the Text. Now let vs a little looke vpon the words. The Propoſition is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A ſhepheard taketh out of the mouth of the Lion two legs or a peece of an eare]</hi> This he doth according to the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.13. <hi>If a ſheepe be torne in peeces by wild beaſts, the ſhepheard is to bring it, or the remnants of it, a leg, or an eare, or the like, to the owner for a witneſſe that it is torne, and he ſhall not need to make reſtitution thereof vnto the owner, ſo he did his beſt to reſcue it.</hi> For a ſhepheard is of duty to reſcue his flocke. <hi>Dauid</hi>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:1736:458"/> did it valiantly. As he kept his fathers ſheepe, there came a <hi>Lion,</hi> and tooke a <hi>Lambe</hi> out of the flocke; and he went out after him, and ſmote him, and deliuered it out of his mouth: and when the <hi>Lion</hi> aroſe againſt him, <hi>he caught him by his beard, and ſmote him, and ſlew him,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.34. My <hi>ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard</hi> here is not ſo happy to ſaue his ſheepe: but his ſheepe being deuoured, he findeth ſome part of it, <hi>two legs,</hi> or <hi>a peece of an eare,</hi> whereby he may excuſe himſelfe to his Maſter for his loſt ſheepe. Theſe parcels, <hi>legge</hi> or <hi>eare,</hi> he taketh <hi>Ex ore Leonis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Out of the mouth of the Lion] Non ex ore Lupi, ſed ex ore Leonis.</hi> He ſaith not, out of the mouth of <hi>the wolfe,</hi> but out of the mouth of the <hi>Lion.</hi> For a thing is recouered with more difficulty and with greater danger from a <hi>Lion</hi> than from a <hi>Wolfe. Iohannes Leo</hi> in his deſcription of <hi>Africke: Credat qui volet, quicquid Leo prehenderit, etiamſi Camelus foret, roſtro aufert;</hi> Beleeue it he that wil, <hi>whatſoeuer a Lion catcheth,</hi> though it bee a <hi>Camell,</hi> hee beareth it away in his mouth. Hence its prouerbially ſaid, <hi>Ex ore Leonis,</hi> out of the Lions mouth, for, <hi>out of extreme danger:</hi> and its vſed when a man hath deliuerance beyond hope. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> vſeth it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>I was deliuered out of the mouth</hi> of the Lion: <hi>the Lion,</hi> not the <hi>Deuill,</hi> as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, nor <hi>Feſtus</hi> the <hi>Preſident of Iudaea,</hi> as <hi>Primaſius</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth; but <hi>Nero,</hi> proud and cruell <hi>Nero,</hi> perſecuting <hi>Nero,</hi> as its expounded by <hi>Chryſoſtome, Theodoret, Theophylact, Oecumenius, Aquinas,</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">Hiſt.

                  <p>The royall Prophet hath it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.21. <hi>Serua me ex ore Leonis.</hi> The words are a part of Chriſts Prayer, <hi>Saue me from the mouth of the Lion.</hi> Some will haue that <hi>Lion</hi> to bee the <hi>Deuill;</hi> ſome <hi>Pilat,</hi> ſome <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> ſome <hi>Herod. Lorinus</hi> will haue him to betoken <hi>Principes &amp; potentes,</hi> all the chiefe Prieſts, Scribes, the Elders of the people, all that were the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifiers of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Here it is in proper termes, without a metaphor, <hi>The ſhepheard taketh out of the mouth of the Lion two legs, or a peece of an eare.</hi> Yet will <hi>Albertus</hi> haue this <hi>Lion</hi> to be, either the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:1736:458"/> 
                     <hi>King of Babylon,</hi> or the <hi>Deuill.</hi> He addeth by way of expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>Os tyranni violentia eſt, os Diaboli peccatum:</hi> the mouth of a <hi>Tyrant</hi> is violence, the mouth of the <hi>Deuill</hi> is ſinne.</p>
                  <p>This Lion <hi>Carthuſian</hi> in his morall explanation expoundeth by the <hi>Deuill,</hi> ſo doth <hi>Salmeron</hi> in his <hi>Tropologie.</hi> And I deny not but that the <hi>Lion</hi> doth many times in a <hi>morall</hi> and <hi>tropolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall</hi> ſenſe ſignifie the <hi>Deuill.</hi> But if we will follow the letter of my Text, this <hi>Lion</hi> doth well reſemble the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> or the <hi>King of Aſſyria, Salmanaſſar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not vnuſuall for a <hi>Lion</hi> to reſemble a <hi>King.</hi> This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance is, <hi>Prou.</hi> 19.12. <hi>The Kings wrath is as the roaring of a Lion.</hi> The roaring of a <hi>Lion</hi> is fearefull and terrible to the beaſts of the foreſt, ſo is the wrath of a <hi>King</hi> to his ſubiects. The like is that, <hi>chap.</hi> 20.2. <hi>The feare of a King is as the roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a Lion.</hi> The feare of a <hi>King;</hi> the terrour which the anger or wrath of a <hi>King</hi> ſtriketh into his ſubiects, is as the <hi>roaring of a Lion,</hi> very terrible. The <hi>Lion</hi> hath a <hi>Beare</hi> for his aſſociate, <hi>Prou.</hi> 28.15. <hi>As a roaring Lion</hi> and <hi>a ranging Beare; ſo is an vngodly Prince ouer the poore people.</hi> An <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Prince</hi> is vnto the people ouer whom he ruleth, as a <hi>roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Lion</hi> or a ranging Beare to a Lambe or Kid. Thus doth a <hi>Lion</hi> reſemble a <hi>King,</hi> either in good or vngodly.</p>
                  <p>Not amiſſe then is it, that <hi>Salmanaſſar, King of Aſſyria,</hi>

                  <p>The fourth reaſon againſt <hi>confidence in man,</hi> I take from the <hi>dangerous effects</hi> thereof.

                  <p>There is a <hi>two-fold hearing</hi> of God when he <hi>ſpeaketh,</hi> or a two-fold hearing of the word of God, <hi>Auditus externus</hi> and <hi>internus,</hi> an outward, and an inward hearing. Theſe two are ſometimes ſeuered, and ſometimes they are ioyned together. For ſome there are that doe heare onely <hi>outwardly,</hi> but <hi>within</hi> they are deafe. Of thoſe it may be ſaid, as it is of the <hi>Idols</hi> of the Heathen, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.6. <hi>They haue eares but they heare not.</hi> They <hi>heare</hi> but <hi>vnderſtand not</hi> what they heare, Theſe are they that <hi>receiue the ſeed by the wayes ſide, Matth.</hi> 13.19.</p>

                  <p>Beſides theſe, ſome there are that heare both <hi>outwardly</hi> and <hi>inwardly,</hi> with the <hi>eare</hi> and with the <hi>heart.</hi> Such a hearing is peculiar to the faithfull: of whom I vnderſtand that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> Faith <hi>commeth by hearing;</hi> that is, faith is bred in the hearts of the elect by the externall hearing of the Word, the holy Spirit working in them. The Preachers ſound vnto their eares the doctrine of the Word. The eares conuey it to the minde: but that is <hi>blinde</hi> to conceiue diuine matters. Wherefore comes <hi>Gods holy Spirit,</hi> who through the doctrine receiued in at the eare, illuminateth the vnderſtanding, openeth the heart, and inclineth the will, to conceiue what the <hi>Preacher</hi> hath deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to giue aſſent vnto it, and to delight therein. Thus comes <hi>faith by hearing,</hi> and <hi>hearing by the word of God.</hi> Whence we may gather this definition of Faith: <hi>Faith is a true perſwaſion

                  <p>This indeed hath beene euermore the right diſpoſition of Gods holy ones.

                  <p>This <hi>word of God</hi> was vnto <hi>Ieremy,</hi> Chap. 15.16. the ioy and reioycing of his heart.

                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore, dearly beloued, let me againe put you in minde of your Chriſtian duty concerning <hi>this word of God,</hi> that as <hi>new borne infants</hi> ye deſire <hi>the ſincere milk thereof to grow ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</hi> Long ye after it; it is your ſpirituall nouriſhment: reioyce in it; place your happineſſe in the vſe of it: Let it be your chiefeſt comfort.</p>

                  <p>Whenſoeuer you ſhall heare this <hi>word of God</hi> read, or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, remember whoſe <hi>Word</hi> it is you heare: and thinke yee thus euery man with himſelfe: Surely this is the <hi>word of my gracious God.</hi> My <hi>God</hi> openeth his mouth from Heauen aboue and ſpeaketh to me, that he might ſaue me. He ſpeaketh to me to keep me from errour; to comfort me in the troubles and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities of this life, and to guide me to the life eternall.</p>
                  <p>If you ſtand thus affected to the <hi>word of God;</hi> if you deſire <hi>the ſincere milke thereof</hi> for your <hi>ſpirituall food,</hi> as the little infant doth the mothers milke for its bodily food: if you finde your ſelues truly to loue it, carefully to deſire to vnderſtand it, and to take comfort in the exerciſes of it; thanke <hi>God</hi> for it; it is a good ſigne; and pray God to increaſe it.</p>
                  <p>But if this <hi>word of God</hi> be a burden to thee; if like a potion it goe downe againſt thy ſtomack, if thou careſt not how little thou be acquainted with it; if thou eſteemeſt not the exerciſes of it; take heed, bewaile thine eſtate; it is a fearefull token; pray God, if thou loue thine owne ſoule, to remoue ſuch thy dulneſſe from thee.</p>
                  <p>And let this ſuffice to haue beene deliuered vpon my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond obſeruation: which was,

<q>God euermore vſeth to denounce grieuous calamities, before they come to paſſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He fore-ſheweth them before hand. The <hi>vniuerſall deluge</hi> was a very grieuous calamity. God foreſhewed it vnto <hi>Noah,</hi> the Preacher of righteouſneſſe, long before he brought in the Floud, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.13.</p>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:1736:471"/>
                  <p>The cry of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> was great, their ſinne was very grieuous, and therefore was God reſolued to deſtroy them: yet would he not doe it, till he had told <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> thereof: the one, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.17. the other, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.13.</p>
                  <p>The ſeuen yeares of famine which were to conſume the land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> God foretold to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> ſeuen yeares before they came, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.25.</p>
                  <p>A man of God is ſent to <hi>Eli,</hi> to foretell him of the euill that ſhould befall his houſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.27. The Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> is ſent to the <hi>Iewes</hi> to <hi>foretell</hi> them of the ſeuenty yeares of their captiuitie in <hi>Babylon, Ier.</hi> 25.12. And here in my text, <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> are called vpon, to <hi>foretell</hi> to the houſe of <hi>Iacob</hi> the miſeries that were readie to fall vpon them. Thus ſtands the doctrine firme;
<q>God euermore vſeth to aduertiſe vs of miſeries, before they doe befall vs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Prophet expreſly and confidently auoucheth it, verſ. 7. of this Chapter. <hi>Surely the Lord God will doe nothing, but he reuealeth his ſecret to his ſeruants, the Prophets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In my expoſition of thoſe words, I gaue of the point in hand a larger proſecution, than the remainder of this houre will affoord. As now, ſo then I proued from the euidence of the word, that <hi>God neuer bringeth any grieuous calamitie</hi> vpon any people or nation, or priuate perſon, but <hi>he doth euermore firſt forewarne the ſame and foretelleth it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hereof I gaue two reaſons: one in reſpect of the <hi>godly;</hi> the other, in reſpect of the <hi>wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Godly.</hi> God is vnwilling at any time to take them at vnawares. He loueth them: he would not haue any of them periſh, but would <hi>they ſhould all repent,</hi> and ſo preuent his iudgements. He is prone to doe good, but ſlow to puniſh; and therefore <hi>praedicit flagella, vt peccantes reſipiſcant;</hi> He fore-ſheweth his iudgements, to draw vs to the amendment of our liues.</p>
                  <p>Now for the wicked. He fore-warneth them alſo of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture iudgements,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Wherefore, beloued, let vs acknowledge the great mercie, and <hi>wonderfull patience</hi> of our good and gracious God, in that he vouchſafeth ſo to deale with vs, to retire vs from ſinne. He needs not, nor is he bound to deale ſo kindly with vs. For it is our part vpon our owne perill <hi>to take heed of his iudgements</hi> that they ouertake vs not.

                  <p>A ſly and ſubtill aduerſary, would ſteale vpon vs when we ſhould leaſt thinke of him, and take vs at any aduantage: but <hi>our louing God</hi> ſeekes not for aduantages againſt vs. He rather prouideth vs meanes for our ſafetie.

For <hi>God</hi> by his infinite and eternall prouidence doth both generally and particularly, wholly and altogether direct and order them. Now if Gods hand be found in the diſpoſing of <hi>Lots;</hi> ſhall it not be found in the ordering of the <hi>viſitations</hi> and <hi>puniſhments</hi> that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to vs in this life for our euill deeds?</p>
                  <p>Another reaſon hereof may be, becauſe <hi>all power is of God</hi> and <hi>from him alone.</hi> There is no creature in the world, deuill, man, or other, that hath <hi>power</hi> any way to hurt or moleſt vs, but from the <hi>Lord.</hi> All <hi>power</hi> is his. Hee alone makes the earth <hi>to open her mouth,</hi> and<note n="a" place="margin">

<q>Whatſoeuer viſitation or puniſhment befalleth vs in this life, it is laid vpon vs by the hand of God, by his good will and pleaſure.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the reaſons of this obſeruation, proceed we to ſee what profit we may reape from hence, for the bettering and amendment of our ſinfull liues.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, from hence we learne in all our troubles and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <hi>to looke vp to God,</hi> as the chiefe and principall Author of them, from whom they come; and <hi>vpon our ſelues</hi> and <hi>our
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:1736:476"/> ſinnes,</hi> the ſole procurers of them, and for whoſe ſake they are ſent. <hi>Eliphar</hi> among his aduertiſements giuen vnto <hi>Iob,</hi> hath this for one, <hi>Miſery commeth not forth of the duſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth trouble ſpring out of the ground, Iob</hi> 5.6. Warning <hi>Iob</hi> thereby to haue an eye to <hi>God,</hi> as the <hi>Author</hi> of his affliction.</p>
                  <p>Its very true, <hi>affliction</hi> comes not vpon vs at all aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: it proceedeth not from the Earth, or the Aire, or the Heauen: it is <hi>the hand of God</hi> that is <hi>heauy</hi> vpon vs for our ſinnes. Great is our folly, that we gaze about here and there, wandring vp and downe in our owne imaginations, and ſearching all the corners of our wits to finde out the <hi>cauſes</hi> of our calamities <hi>without vs,</hi> whereas indeed the true and right cauſe of them is <hi>within vs.</hi> Wee are euermore accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing either heat or cold, or drought or moiſture, or the aire, or the ground, one thing or other to be the cauſe of our miſeries, but we will not be brought to acknowledge their true and proper cauſe, euen the <hi>ſinne</hi> that reigneth in vs. I deny not, but the <hi>Lord</hi> hath <hi>ſecret cauſes,</hi> whereof wee know not, either the <hi>manifeſtation of his owne workes,</hi> or <hi>the triall of our faith;</hi> yet the reuealed and originall cauſe of all our miſeries, hath his beginning and ſpring-head from within vs; from our iniquities.</p>
                  <p>The Prophet <hi>Ieremy, Lament.</hi> 3.39. makes this enquiry: <hi>Wherefore ſhould a liuing man complaine,</hi> a man <hi>for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſinne,</hi> wherefore ſhould he complaine? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he fits this anſwer, <hi>man ſuffereth for his ſinnes:</hi> implying thus much, that it is meere folly for a man to vex his ſoule, in miſ-iudging of his eſtate, and ſeeking by-paths to winde himſelfe out of miſeries; ſith miſeries befall no man, but for <hi>his ſinnes.</hi> Whereupon ſweetly <hi>Pellican, Non murmuret af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictus contra Dominum,</hi> Let not the man that is in affliction murmure againſt the Lord, for the Lord doth all things well. <hi>Sed ſi quid patitur imputet peccatis ſuis, quae Deus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punita non ſinit:</hi> But if he ſuffer any thing, let him lay the blame thereof <hi>vpon his ſinnes,</hi> which God leaueth not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed.</p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:1736:476"/>
                  <p>Our bleſſed Lord and Sauiour <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> hauing cured the man that had beene diſeaſed eight and thirty yeeres, and finding him in the Temple, aduiſed him to conſider the <hi>cauſe</hi> of his ſo long and lamentable a viſitation; ſaying vnto him, <hi>Behold, thou art made whole, ſinne no more, leſt a worſe thing come vnto thee, Ioh.</hi> 5.14. intimating, that his diſeaſe of ſo long continuance was laid vpon him <hi>for his ſinnes.</hi> Out of doubt this diſeaſed man thought himſelfe happy, when hee was reſtored to health: yet leſt he ſhould reſt therein, our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour</hi> telleth him, he muſt change his heart, and <hi>ſinne no more, leſt a worſe thing ſhould befall him. Sciebat Dominus ei quem ſalvum fecerat, meritis peccatorum illum etiam carnis acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſe languorem: Auguſtine de fide &amp; operibus, cap.</hi> 20. The Lord knew, that that ſame infirmity of body vpon the man, whom he had healed, befell him <hi>for his ſinnes ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I need not preſſe other inſtances of holy Writ for the further illuſtration of the point in hand, ſith my Text is plaine for it. By my Text its plaine, that the viſitation which the Lord was reſolued to lay vpon the houſe of <hi>Iacob,</hi> was for the <hi>preuarications</hi> thereof; it was for their reuoltings, and tranſgreſſions, and wickedneſſe: it was for the ſinnes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The ſinnes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were the cauſe of Gods viſitation vpon them.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, Beloued, let euery viſitation of God vpon vs, be vnto vs <hi>a Sermon of repentance,</hi> to put vs in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of our ſinnes, and to admoniſh vs, not to ſow any more vpon the furrowes of vnrighteouſneſſe, leſt we reape a more plentifull harueſt of affliction, and whenſoeuer any viſitation ſhall be vpon vs, let vs deſire God to ſanctifie the <hi>croſſe</hi> vnto vs, that it may <hi>conſume</hi> ſinne in vs, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke vs to a more holy conuerſation. Thus haue you your firſt vſe.</p>
                  <p>Now in the ſecond place, the conſideration of this truth, that <hi>whatſoeuer viſitation or puniſhment befalleth any of vs in this life, it is laid vpon vs by the hand of God,</hi> may teach vs to haue <hi>patience in our troubles,</hi> not to repine or grudge when we are vnder the rod of affliction. Sith it is the hand of God
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:1736:477"/> that doth <hi>viſit</hi> vs, we are to take <hi>it patiently,</hi> as a dutifull child beareth the chaſtiſements of his louing father.</p>
                  <p>This was the practiſe of holy <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 39.9. where he ſaith, <hi>Obmutui &amp; non aperui os meum, quoniam tu feciſti;</hi> Lord I was dumbe and opened not my mouth, becauſe thou didſt it: <hi>Quoniam tu feciſti,</hi> becauſe thou didſt it: this was the fountaine, whence he drew his patience. To the reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the wicked, to their reproaches, to their malicious detractions, to their ſcoffings, to their iniurious ſpeeches, <hi>Obmutuit,</hi> he anſwered not a word, but was as the man that is <hi>dumbe,</hi> as he that hath no tongue, as he whoſe mouth is ſhut: he excuſed not himſelfe, he returned no euill language, but he held his peace and bore it <hi>patiently.</hi> The fountaine of this his patience was, <hi>Quoniam tu feciſti,</hi> becauſe thou didſt it. Lord, <hi>thou didſt</hi> it: But thou art a <hi>Father,</hi> I am thy <hi>ſonne:</hi> therefore what <hi>thou didſt,</hi> thou didſt it for my good; and therefore I hold my peace.</p>
                  <p>Out of this fountaine <hi>Iob</hi> drew his <hi>patience.</hi> When he had loſt his children, and was depriued of all his goods, he mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured not, nor charged he God fooliſhly. All he ſaid was, <hi>Dominus abſtulit,</hi> the <hi>Lord hath taken away,</hi> and he hath done ſo by good right, <hi>Quia etiam dedit,</hi> for firſt he <hi>gaue it, Iob</hi> 1.21. The ground of this his patience was, <hi>Domine tu fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſti;</hi> Lord, thou haſt done it. Thou Lord haſt taken from me my children, and all my ſubſtance; and therefore I hold my peace.</p>
                  <p>Out of this very Fountaine <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe drew his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; when commanding <hi>Peter</hi> to put vp his ſword into the ſheath, he asked him this queſtion, <hi>Calicem, quem dedit mihi Pater,</hi>

They <hi>inſulted</hi> ouer him, and he reſiſted not; they <hi>threatned</hi> him, and he anſwered not: they loaded him with iniuries, and he ſuſtained them; they bound him faſt, and he withſtood them not; they ſmote him, and he endured it; they <hi>flouted</hi> him, and he held his peace; they <hi>railed againſt him,</hi> and he defended not himſelfe; they <hi>curſed him,</hi> and he prayed for them. O the infinite patience of our ſweet <hi>Ieſus,</hi> which he drew from this fountaine, <hi>Domine tu feciſti;</hi> Lord, thou haſt prouided this cup for me, and I refuſe it not!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Domine tu feciſti;</hi> Lord thou haſt done it: It is the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe fountaine of patience, neuer to bee exhauſted or drawne dry.

<q>Places of Idols, together with the Idolaters, ſhall be puniſhed with deſolation and confuſion: <hi>the</hi> places <hi>with</hi> deſolation, <hi>the</hi> Idolaters <hi>with</hi> confuſion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Places of Idols</hi> ſhall be puniſhed with deſolation. <hi>Gilgal,</hi>
                     <pb n="292" facs="tcp:1736:480"/> once famous <hi>Gilgal,</hi> ennobled by many accidents, which hapned there, became afterwards through the Idolatry there committed, ſo infamous, and of ſuch bad note, that the people of <hi>Iudah</hi> are forbidden to reſort vnto it, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.15. But where is ſhe now? Lieth ſhe not vnder the ruines of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation?</hi> And <hi>Bethel</hi> once famous too, for that ſhe was the <hi>houſe of God,</hi> by the like abuſe became <hi>Beth-auen,</hi> the houſe <hi>of an Idoll.</hi> But where is ſhe now? Doubtleſſe ſhe is meaſured with the line of <hi>deſolation,</hi> according to this prophecie.</p>
                  <p>As the <hi>places of Idols</hi> are puniſhed with <hi>deſolation:</hi> ſo are the <hi>Idolaters</hi> with <hi>confuſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Idolaters,</hi> whilſt they flouriſh with proſperity, they flatter themſelues in their ſinnes, and become hereby more obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in their ſuperſtitions, imagining that they are priuileged from Gods iudgements, and haue the fruition of all his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings for their falſe worſhip ſake: and if the hand of God hap to lie heauy vpon them, then doe they double their deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to their <hi>Idols,</hi> that by <hi>their helpe</hi> they may be deliuered. But when they finde their hope fruſtrate, and themſelues for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of their <hi>Idols</hi> when moſt they need their helpe, then ouerwhelmed with <hi>confuſion,</hi> they bewaile their former folly, that they ſpent vpon them ſo much vnrewarded coſt and bootleſſe labour.</p>
                  <p>Of this <hi>confuſion</hi> or ſhame, the portion of Idolaters, I thus reade, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.7. <hi>Confundantur omnes, qui adorant ſculpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia:</hi> Confounded be all they that ſerue <hi>grauen images,</hi> that boaſt themſelues of <hi>Idols.</hi> And <hi>Eſay</hi> 42.17. <hi>They ſhall be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned backe,</hi> they ſhall be greatly aſhamed, that <hi>truſt in grauen images,</hi>

Yet an example here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you haue in <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.29. who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with <hi>ſhame,</hi> when they were in the ſight of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple abandoned of his helpe, when they moſt needed, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored it.</p>
                  <p>Thus is my doctrine confirmed. Will you now ſee how vſefull it is? Here then ſee condemned all ſuch, as doe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:1736:480"/> worſhip for God, that which <hi>is not God:</hi> ſuch are <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,</hi> who worſhip <hi>deuils, men,</hi> and other <hi>creatures,</hi> erecting to their honour grauen and carued images, pictures, and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. From this <hi>Idolatry</hi> we may not exempt the now-Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for that ſhe yeeldeth religious worſhip to <hi>creatures, Angels,</hi> and <hi>men:</hi> and to <hi>men</hi> not ſuch onely, as haue beene held for Saints in reſpect of their faith and holy life: but alſo ſuch as haue beene noted for their wicked conuerſation, as their Saint <hi>George,</hi> Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> Saint <hi>Dominick, Ignatius Loiola,</hi> and the like: yea ſuch as neuer had any being in the world, as their Saint <hi>Hippolytus,</hi> Saint <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> Saint <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine,</hi> fictitious and counterfeited <hi>Saints:</hi> to ſuch they haue ſet vp <hi>pictures, images,</hi> and <hi>ſtatues,</hi> and thoſe forſooth muſt be worſhipped, and that with <hi>religious worſhip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And doe they not, thinke you, deſerue it, ſith they are ſo wonderouſly decked and adorned? <hi>Garlands</hi> and <hi>Coronets</hi> are ſet on their <hi>heads,</hi> precious <hi>pearles</hi> hang about their <hi>necks,</hi> their <hi>fingers</hi> ſhine with <hi>rings</hi> beſet with precious ſtones; their bodies are clothed with garments ſtiffe with gold. And are not theſe worthy to be adored? If you ſhould ſee the images of their <hi>men Saints,</hi> you would beleeue they were ſome Princes of <hi>Perſia,</hi> by their proud apparell: and the idols of their women-ſaints you would take to be ſome nice and well trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>harlots,</hi> tempting their <hi>Paramours</hi> to wantonneſſe.</p>
                  <p>The Churches and Chappels that are thus bedeckt and trimmed, are they not as this <hi>Bethel</hi> with her golden calfe? Yes. And if there be no reformation, a time will come, when the lot of <hi>Bethel</hi> ſhall be theirs, euen to thoſe Idoll-houſes, <hi>deſolation,</hi> and <hi>confuſion</hi> to the <hi>Idolaters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſhall <hi>idolatrous places</hi> and <hi>perſons</hi> be puniſhed, they with <hi>deſolation,</hi> theſe with <hi>confuſion?</hi> Let the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof inflame our hearts to be more zealouſly thankfull to the Lord, for that hauing freed vs from Heatheniſh and Antichriſtian darkneſſe, from <hi>idolatry,</hi> and the ſeruice of <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen images,</hi> he hath giuen vs the cleare light of his gracious Goſpell, through the illumination whereof wee may bee brought to the right knowledge of the true worſhip of him,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:1736:481"/> the onely liuing God. For ſo, by his ſole goodneſſe are wee deliuered from all feare of the puniſhment allotted to <hi>Bethel,</hi> and the worſhippers of the <hi>Idoll</hi> there.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, from this conſideration we are to be admoniſhed, that abhorring and renouncing <hi>idols,</hi> and all manner of <hi>ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous</hi> ſuperſtition, which will leaue vs without helpe and hope in our greateſt extremities, we doe cleaue faſt vnto the true <hi>Iehouah,</hi> performing vnto him ſuch faithfull and ſincere ſeruice as he requireth in his Word, without the mixture of humane inuentions: ſo ſhall we in the day of viſitation bee preſerued from all euill.</p>
                  <p>But ſay, that the Lord for <hi>his glory</hi> and <hi>our triall</hi> will bring vs to the touchſtone of aduerſity, and ſuffer vs to taſte of ſome calamity and miſery, yet will he giue vs ſuch a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table feeling of his fauour, and will ſo arme vs with power and patience to beare our troubles, that we ſhall not need to feare <hi>confuſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no feare of <hi>confuſion</hi> or <hi>ſhame</hi> where true religion is. No: there is none, <hi>True religion</hi> cleanſed from all dregs of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> maketh not aſhamed. So ſaith the kingly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.5. <hi>They ſhall looke vnto him, and run vnto him, and their faces ſhall not not be aſhamed. They,</hi> the truly religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the humble and faithfull, <hi>ſhall looke vnto the Lord,</hi> ſhall diligently and carefully attend for aid and ſuccour from him: they ſhall <hi>runne vnto him</hi> with haſte in their troubles, in aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of finding eaſe; and <hi>their faces ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> They ſhall not hang downe their heads and countenances for ſhame, as they were wont to doe, but ſhall lift vp their heads, ſhall looke on high, and ſhall goe with confidence to the God of their ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>That promiſe of the Lord, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.26. <hi>My people ſhall neuer be aſhamed,</hi> repeated in the verſe following, <hi>My people ſhall neuer be aſhamed,</hi> is a promiſe to the <hi>religious;</hi> for the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious only are <hi>his people.</hi> My people, ſaith he, ſhall neuer be aſhamed. O what a maruellous benefit a man hath by <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> which he cannot haue by any other thing in the world? There is nothing in all our life, whereof we haue not need to
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:1736:481"/> repent, except it be our <hi>religion, the feare of God.</hi> Our words, our workes, our gettings, our ſpendings, our wandrings vp and downe, our negligence in our vocations, our ſleeping, our eating, our drinking out of meaſure; of all theſe we haue need to repent. Our thoughts, our toyes, our trifles, our wantonnes, our luſt, our hatred, our wrath, our malice, our many other enormities; of all theſe we may well be <hi>aſhamed:</hi> but of <hi>true religion</hi> and the <hi>feare of the Lord,</hi> we neither need to repent, nor to be aſhamed. If thou forſakeſt the world, and hateſt <hi>Idols,</hi> and beleeueſt in the Lord, and mourneſt for thy ſins, and ſtudieſt the Scriptures, and heareſt the Preachers, and obeyeſt the Goſpell, and prayeſt, and watcheſt, and faſteſt, and endureſt many troubles, and art ready to die if need be; and all for loue of the Lord Ieſus: thou needeſt not to repent, or to be aſhamed hereof. For happy art thou. Thou haſt fought a good fight. Goe on with courage; finiſh thy courſe, keepe the faith Henceforth there is laid vp for thee a Crowne of righteouſneſſe, which the Lord, <hi>the righteous Iudge,</hi> ſhall giue thee in that grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

No, His eye is to him, that is <hi>agens principalis,</hi> or <hi>Primus motor,</hi> euen to the <hi>Lord,</hi> the Principall agent and firſt mouer in all this buſineſſe. <hi>Shimei,</hi> he knowes, is but <hi>the inſtrument</hi> to worke the will of the Lord. And therefore he ſaith to <hi>Abiſhai,</hi> 2 Sam. 16.10. <hi>Let him curſe, becauſe the</hi> Lord <hi>hath ſaid</hi> vnto him, <hi>Curſe Dauid.</hi> Who ſhall then ſay, <hi>Wherefore haſt thou done ſo?</hi> Suffer him to curſe, for <hi>the Lord</hi> hath bidden him.</p>
                  <p>Not vnlike was the carriage of the bleſſed Apoſtles, <hi>Peter, Iohn,</hi> and the reſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.27. Though <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilat,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the <hi>people of Iſrael,</hi> had crucified and put to death <hi>the Lord of life,</hi> our Lord and Sauiour <hi>Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> yet did not the Apoſtles therefore grow into a rage, or bitter ſpeeches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. In that great execution of the Lord <hi>Ieſus,</hi> there was vpon the hand of God. They knew, that <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilat, the Gentiles, and the Iews</hi> were but inſtruments. So their acknowledgement before the Lord, verſ. 28. <hi>Of a truth both</hi> Herod <hi>and</hi> Pontius Pilat, <hi>&amp; the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>&amp; the People of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were gathered together againſt thine holy Childe Ieſus, for to doe whatſoeuer thy hand and thy counſel determined before to be done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus according to the examples of holy <hi>Iob,</hi> King <hi>Dauid,</hi> and the bleſſed <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> we are in the miſeries and calamities that doe befall vs in this life, to looke not ſo much to <hi>the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,</hi> as to the <hi>Lord</hi> that <hi>ſmiteth</hi> by them.</p>
                  <p>And why ſo? The reaſon is, becauſe all <hi>inſtruments</hi> are <hi>ſecond cauſes;</hi> Angels, men, or other creatures haue no power at all againſt vs, but what is giuen them of God. So <hi>Ieſus</hi> told <hi>Pilat,</hi> who had proudly ſaid vnto him, <hi>Knoweſt thou not, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and haue power to releaſe thee?</hi> No, ſaith <hi>Ieſus,</hi> thou <hi>couldſt haue no power at all againſt me, except it were giuen thee,</hi>

                  <p>One is, for the reproofe of ſuch, who are of opinion, that God doth only <hi>ſuffer</hi> many things to be done. If he be <hi>agens principalis,</hi> the <hi>principall Agent</hi> in all actions, and all other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents are but <hi>his inſtruments,</hi> then is he not only <hi>a ſufferer,</hi> but alſo an <hi>orderer, guider,</hi> and <hi>gouernour</hi> of all actions.</p>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:1736:484"/>
                  <p>The ſecond is for the confutation of ſuch as in their vaine thoughts imagine, that the miſeries and calamities which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall men in this life, are but their <hi>miſ-fortunes.</hi> If God be <hi>agens principalis,</hi> if he be the principall agent in all that is done vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, then wretched man bleare not thine own eies to aſcribe that to <hi>haphazzard</hi> wherein the ſtrokes of Gods hand appeare.</p>
                  <p>The third is for the admoniſhing of vs all, that in our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or calamities, we behaue our ſelues with <hi>patience</hi> toward the <hi>inſtruments,</hi> wherewith God <hi>ſmiteth</hi> vs. It will very ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeme a man to be like vnto the <hi>dogge,</hi> that ſnatcheth at the <hi>ſtone</hi> throwne at him, without regard vnto the <hi>thrower.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth is for conſolation. It will be a comfort to vs in miſery and diſtreſſe, to remember that God is <hi>agens principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> that he hath a chiefe hand in all our troubles, and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of what ranke ſoeuer, are but his <hi>inſtruments;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can no further preuaile againſt vs, than the <hi>hand</hi> and <hi>counſell of God</hi> giues them leaue. This our comfort may <hi>reſt</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>God is faithfull: he will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vs to be tempted aboue that we are able to beare,</hi> but will euen <hi>giue an iſſue with the temptation,</hi> that we may be able to beare it. <hi>Qui enim dat tentanti Diabolo licentia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ipſe dat tentatis miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; Pet.

                  <p>It is not to be doubted, but that <hi>Amos</hi> by theſe <hi>winter</hi> and <hi>ſummer</hi> houſes noteth the places of Princes and great ones of the State of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> As for the poorer ſort, it is enough for them, if they haue but <hi>a cottage</hi> for their ſhelter as well in the <hi>winter</hi>

                  <p>Thus much bee ſpoken for the expoſition of the words. Now let vs ſee what point of obſeruation may from hence ariſe for our further profit.</p>
                  <p>In that our Prophet here ſeemeth to reproue and tax the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:1736:487"/> 
                     <hi>rich men,</hi> Princes, and others in the Kingdome of the <hi>Ten Tribes</hi> for their variety, coſt, and ſtate in <hi>their buildings,</hi> by threatning deſtruction to their <hi>winter houſes</hi> and <hi>ſummer hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> to their <hi>houſes of iuory,</hi> and to their <hi>great houſes,</hi> this queſtion is propounded: Whether <hi>it be lawfull for Kings, Princes, and other men of ſtate to build ſuch houſes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Petrus Luſitanus</hi> thus reſolues it. If <hi>Kings, Princes,</hi> and other men of ſtate be otherwiſe <hi>godly</hi> and <hi>faithfull,</hi> and ſtudious of Gods worſhip, and <hi>mindfull of the poore,</hi> they may without ſinne build ſuch <hi>ſumptuous</hi> and <hi>magnificent houſes</hi> and <hi>palaces,</hi> according to their owne reuenues and eſtate.</p>
                  <p>Such houſes King <hi>Salomon</hi> built, and is not reproued. He was building of his <hi>owne houſe</hi> thirteene yeeres. He built alſo the <hi>houſe of the foreſt</hi> of <hi>Lebanon:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 7.1.</note> and he made a <hi>houſe</hi> for <hi>Pharaohs daughter.</hi> All theſe houſes were of precious ſtones according to the meaſures of hewed ſtones, ſawed with Sawes within and without, euen from the foundation vnto the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 7.9. Theſe doubtleſſe were <hi>coſtly</hi> and <hi>magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent houſes,</hi> yet is <hi>Salomon</hi> commended for building them.</p>
                  <p>And yet neuertheleſſe is all ſuch building blame-worthy, and to be reproued, if it exceed the <hi>meaſure</hi> of the <hi>ability</hi> and <hi>dignity</hi> of the <hi>builder.</hi> For then there is a neceſſity of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the poore. Againſt ſuch builders there is a wo gone forth, <hi>Ier.</hi> 22.13. <hi>Woe vnto him that buildeth by vnrighteouſneſſe, and his chambers by wrong.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, though a <hi>builder</hi> exceed not the meaſure of his ability and dignity, yet may his building bee reproueable through the vanity of <hi>his intention;</hi> if his intendment be not <hi>Gods honour,</hi> but his owne praiſe; for haughtineſſe and pride of minde makes the beſt action faulty.</p>
                  <p>So much for the queſtion: proceed we to the obſeruation.</p>
                  <p>From the demolition and ouerthrow here threatned, and after in due time brought to paſſe vpon the <hi>winter houſe,</hi> with the <hi>ſummer houſe,</hi> vpon the <hi>houſes of iuory,</hi> and vpon the <hi>great houſes</hi> in the Kingdome of the <hi>Ten Tribes,</hi> we may make this obſeruation: that
<q>All the aid and ſuccour a man hath from his buildings whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:1736:487"/> is vaine, if once the wrath of God break forth againſt him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If once the wrath of God breake forth againſt vs, alas, what ſhall <hi>faire, rich,</hi> and <hi>great buildings</hi> auaile vs? If theſe might haue yeelded any ſuccour in the day of the Lords viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> might haue found it. But they together with their <hi>buildings,</hi> thoughfull of ſtate and pompe, are peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and come to nought. And is it not in like ſort fallen out with other moſt flouriſhing common wealths, and moſt migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Kingdomes? The daily change of things doth abundantly euict, that there is nothing in this world perpetuall.</p>
                  <p>Here then may <hi>Filii huius ſeculi,</hi> this worlds darlings, <hi>ſome rich men,</hi> be reproued for a vanity of theirs. They ſee that <hi>death</hi> comes alike to <hi>all;</hi> to the <hi>rich,</hi> as to the <hi>poore;</hi> and yet they dreame of nothing elſe, than of a <hi>perpetuity</hi> of life here. For ſo they order all their waies, as if they were to liue here for euer. They build them houſes, <hi>great</hi> and <hi>goodly</hi> houſes, and ſpare no coſt to adorne and deck them gorgeouſly, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing hereby to continue a <hi>perpetuity</hi> of their name.</p>
                  <p>This vanity of theirs the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> of old hath very well diſcouered, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.10, 11. They <hi>ſee that wiſe men alſo die and periſh together, as well as the ignorant and fooliſh, and leaue their riches for other.</hi> And yet they thinke, <hi>that their houſes ſhall continue for euer:</hi> and that their <hi>dwelling places ſhall endure</hi> from generation to generation: and call their lands <hi>after their owne names.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By which their vanity they ſeeme to acknowledge no other life but this; Whatſoeuer we preach vnto them of that <hi>better</hi> life, that heauenly and eternall life, they beleeue it not; but rather they deride it as fabulous. But if at any time they are conuinced in conſcience, that there remaineth after this a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life, yet they deſire it not. Their onely deſire and wiſh is, to dwell here for euer. Their inward thought is, that their houſes <hi>ſhall continue for euer,</hi> and their dwelling places <hi>to all generations:</hi> and for this purpoſe, they call their lands <hi>after their owne names.</hi> They will no other Paradiſe but this.</p>
                  <p>As vaine were they that built the Tower of <hi>Babel, Gen.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Goe to,</hi> ſay they, <hi>Let vs build vs a City, and a Tower, whoſe top
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:1736:488"/> may reach vnto Heauen,</hi> and let vs <hi>make vs a name, leſt we bee ſcattered abroad vpon the face of the whole earth.</hi> Let vs <hi>build vs a City and a Tower!</hi> One reaſon is a deſire of dominion. <hi>Hugo</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">

Another reaſon is, <hi>Ne diuidaemur,</hi> leſt <hi>we be ſcattered.</hi> They built them a City and a Tower to maintaine ſociety that they might dwell together, and <hi>not be ſcattered</hi> vpon the face of the whole earth.<note place="margin">Antiq.

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Ioſephus</hi> thinks they did it of purpoſe, to oppoſe themſelues againſt the ordinance and commandement of God, who would haue them diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into diuers parts, that the world might be repleniſhed.

                     <hi>Philo</hi> ſaith, they did <hi>write their names in this Tower,</hi> to reuiue their memory with poſterity.</p>
                  <p>In this their proud enterpriſe they ſinned grieuouſly. They ſinned through their impiety towards God. <hi>Erigebant tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim contra Dominum,</hi> ſaith <hi>S. Auguſtine, De Ciuit, Dei l.</hi> 16. <hi>c.</hi> 4. they erected a Tower in deſpight of God. The Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> according to this patterne bringeth in the King of <hi>Babel</hi> thus vaunting himſelfe, <hi>I will aſcend aboue the height of the clouds, I will be like the moſt high, Chap.</hi> 14.14.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they ſinned through <hi>vanity.</hi> For what more vaine than to neglect <hi>Heauen,</hi> where onely immortality is to be found, and to ſeeke to be famous on <hi>earth,</hi> where there is nothing that is not vaine, and tranſitory? See, ſaith <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,</hi> the root of euill, they ſeeke to be famous, <hi>aedificiis, non cleemoſynis,</hi> by buildings, not by almes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they ſinned through <hi>diſobedience.</hi> For knowing, that it was Gods ordinance, that the earth by them ſhould be repleniſhed, they did wilfully oppoſe themſelues againſt it. They would liue together, and would not be diſperſed, as euen now I told you out of <hi>Ioſephus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they ſinned through <hi>impudency. Philo</hi> cries out vpon it; <hi>O inſignem impudentiam!</hi> O notorious impudency! whereas they ſhould rather haue couered their ſinnes, they
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:1736:488"/> proclaime their <hi>pride,</hi> their <hi>tyranny,</hi> their <hi>voluptuouſneſſe,</hi> to all poſterity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abſolon</hi> was a vaine builder too. Too much giuen to ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious oſtentation, he built him a pillar to be a monument of his fame vnto poſterity. And why did he ſo? becauſe forſooth he had no ſonne <hi>to keepe his name in remembrance,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Carthuſian</hi> giues the reaſon, becauſe he was <hi>cupidiſſimus laudis humanae,</hi> moſt deſirous of the praiſe of men. But how fared he with this his pride? The vengeance of God did ſoone attache him. For beſides that, he was ſmitten through with <hi>darts,</hi> as he <hi>hung by the haire of the head,</hi> ſo was he alſo <hi>ſtoned</hi> by Gods iuſt iudgement, by whoſe Law, they which were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to their parents, were ſtoned to death: and now in ſtead of that pillar, he lieth ſhrowded <hi>vnder a heape of ſtones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I haue yet one builder more to acquaint you with, and he is as vaine as thoſe that are gone before. It is the <hi>rich man</hi> in the <hi>Goſpell, Luk.</hi> 12.16. When his ground had brought forth plentifully, he ſaid within himſelfe: <hi>What ſhall I doe, becauſe I haue no roome where to beſtow my fruits?</hi> This will I doe: <hi>I will pull downe my Barnes, and build greater,</hi> and <hi>there will I beſtow all my fruits and my goods.</hi> And will ſay to my ſoule, <hi>Soule,</hi> thou haſt much goods <hi>laid vp for many yeeres;</hi> take thine eaſe, <hi>eat, drinke, and be merry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Out of doubt this man thought himſelfe paſſing wiſe, in his reſolution to build <hi>new barnes.</hi> But let vs a little examine his care. I haue, ſaith he, no roome where to <hi>beſtow</hi> my fruits. <hi>Mentitur,</hi> ſaith <hi>Stella.</hi> He lies; Had he not the houſes of the poore and their bodies, where he might <hi>beſtow his fruits?</hi> Theſe were the <hi>Barnes</hi> prouided for him by the <hi>Lord,</hi> where if he would lay vp his fruits, neither <hi>moth</hi> nor <hi>ruſt</hi> could hurt them. Thou canſt not any way better preſerue thy fruits than if thou diſtribute them among the poore. Herewith agreeth that of <hi>Salomon, Prou.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Giue vnto the poore of the firſt fruits of thine increaſe: ſo</hi> ſhall <hi>thy barnes be filled with plenty.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, he is a <hi>foole,</hi> becauſe hee keepeth thoſe things which are loſt by keeping, and by loſing are preſerued.
